<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
IN THE HOWE OF THE MEARNS.
</h3>

<p>
'This will end in a scene, Fettercairn, and
you know how I hate scenes.'
</p>

<p>
'So do I, they are such deuced bad form.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall need all my self-possession to get
over the <i>esclandre</i> this affair may cause,'
exclaimed the lady, fanning herself violently.
</p>

<p>
'Well, life is made up of getting over
things,' responded her husband.
</p>

<p>
'But not things so disgraceful as this,
Fettercairn!'
</p>

<p>
'Is this son of yours in his senses?'
</p>

<p>
'Who is that loves? it has been asked,'
said the culprit referred to.
</p>

<p>
'A marriage between you and a penniless
girl in her rank of life is not to be thought of,
Lennard.'
</p>

<p>
'Her rank of life, father?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes!'
</p>

<p>
'Her father's rank was superior to that of
the first of our family, when life began with
him.'
</p>

<p>
'What is that to you or to me now?'
</p>

<p>
'Much to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Too much, it would seem.'
</p>

<p>
The excited speakers were a Peer, Cosmo,
Lord Fettercairn, his wife, the Lady thereof,
and their youngest son, Lennard Melfort, a
captain of the line, home on leave from
India, who had been somewhat timidly
venturing to break&mdash;knowing the inordinate
family vanity of his parents&mdash;we say to break
the news of his love for a girl possessed of
more beauty than this world's goods; and, in
his excitement and indignation, his lordship's
usual easy, indolent, and drawling way was
forgotten now when addressing his son.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo, Lord Fettercairn of that Ilk (and
Strathfinella in the Mearns) was by nature a
proud, cold, selfish, and calculating man,
whose chief passion in life was a combined
spirit of enormous vanity and acquisitiveness,
which he inherited from his predecessors,
whom he resembled in political caution and
selfishness, and also in personal appearance,
to judge from the portraits of three generations,
by Sir John de Medina, Aikman, and
Raeburn, adorning the walls of the stately
room in the house of Craigengowan, where
this rather stormy interview took place.
</p>

<p>
Tall and thin in figure, with flat square
shoulders and sandy-coloured hair, cold grey
eyes, and irregular features, he was altogether
a contrast to his son Lennard, who inherited
his slightly aquiline nose and perfect face
from his mother, but his firm dark eyes and
rich brown hair from a previous generation;
and these, together with an olive complexion,
rendered more dusky by five years' exposure
to an Indian sun, made his aspect a very
striking one.
</p>

<p>
My Lady Fettercairn's birth and breeding
were, as Sir Bernard Burke had recorded,
irreproachable, and she certainly seemed a
<i>grande dame</i> to the tips of her long slender
fingers.  She was about forty-five years of
age, but looked ten younger.  The upper
part of her aristocratic face was strikingly
handsome; but the lower, with its proud and
firm lips, was less pleasant to look at.  Her
complexion was almost colourless, her hair
of the lightest brown, like her eyebrows and
lashes; while her eyes were clear and blue as
an Alpine sky, and, as Lennard often thought
with a sigh, they seemed quite as&mdash;cold.
</p>

<p>
Her manner was always calm, assured, and
self-possessed.  She would smile, but that
smile never degenerated into honest laughter,
while her pale and impressive face was
without a line&mdash;especially on her forehead&mdash;that
seemed to indicate either thought or
reflection, and certainly she had never known
care or sorrow or even annoyance until
now.
</p>

<p>
'She is beautiful, mother,' urged the
young man, breaking an ominous silence, with
reference to the object of his love.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps; but she is not one of us,'
exclaimed Lady Fettercairn, cresting up her
handsome head haughtily, and a whole
volume of intense pride and hauteur was
centred in the last word she spoke.
</p>

<p>
'Who is this Flora MacIan, as she calls
herself?' asked his father in a similar tone;
'but I need not ask.  You have already told
us she is the governess in a house you have
been recently visiting&mdash;that of Lady
Drumshoddy&mdash;a governess, with all her beauty, poor
and obscure.'
</p>

<p>
'Not so obscure,' said Lennard, a wave of
red passing under the tan of his olive cheek;
'her father was a gallant old officer of the
Ross-shire Buffs, who earned his V.C. at the
battle of Khooshab, in Persia, and her only
brother and support fell when leading on his
Grenadiers at the storming of Lucknow.  The
old captain was, as his name imports, a cadet
of the Macdonalds of Glencoe.'
</p>

<p>
'With a pedigree of his family, no doubt,
from the grounding of the Ark to the battle
of Culloden,' sneered his father.
</p>

<p>
'Then his family would end soon after ours
began,' retorted the son, becoming greatly
ruffled now.  'You know, father, we can't
count much beyond three generations ourselves.'
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn, wounded thus in his
sorest point, grew white with anger.
</p>

<p>
'We always suspected you of having some
secret, Lennard,' said his mother severely.
</p>

<p>
'Ah, mother, unfortunately, as some one
says, a secret is like a hole in your coat&mdash;the
more you try to hide it, the more it is seen.'
</p>

<p>
'An aphorism, and consequently vulgar;
does <i>she</i> teach you this style of thing?' asked
the haughty lady, while Lennard reddened
again with annoyance, and gave his dark
moustache a vicious twist, but sighed and
strove to keep his temper.
</p>

<p>
'I have found and felt it very bitter, father,
to live under false colours,' said he gently and
appealingly, 'and to keep that a secret from
you both, which should be no secret at all.'
</p>

<p>
'We would rather not have heard this
secret,' replied Lord Fettercairn sternly, while
tugging at his sandy-coloured mutton-chop
whiskers.
</p>

<p>
'Then would you have preferred that I
should be deceitful to you, and false to the
dear girl who loves and trusts me?'
</p>

<p>
'I do not choose to consider <i>her</i>,'  was the
cold reply.
</p>

<p>
'But I do, and must, now!'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Because we are already married&mdash;she is
my wife,' was the steady response.
</p>

<p>
'Married!' exclaimed his father and mother
with one accord, as they started from their
chairs together, and another ominous silence
of a minute ensued.
</p>

<p>
'My poor, lost boy&mdash;the prey of an artful
minx!' said Lady Fettercairn, looking as if
she would like to weep; but tears were rather
strangers to her cold blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Mother, dear mother, if you only knew
her, you would not talk thus of Flora,' urged
Lennard almost piteously.  'If we had it in
our power to give love and to withhold it, easy
indeed would our progress be through life.'
</p>

<p>
'Love&mdash;nonsense!'
</p>

<p>
'Save to the two most interested, who are
judges of it,' said Lennard.  'Surely you
loved my father, and he you.'
</p>

<p>
'Our case was very different,' replied Lady
Fettercairn, in her anger actually forgetting
herself so far as to bite feathers off her fan
with her firm white teeth.
</p>

<p>
'How, mother dear?'
</p>

<p>
'In rank and wealth we were equal.'
</p>

<p>
Lennard sighed, and said:
</p>

<p>
'I little thought that you, who loved me
so, would prove all but one of the mothers of
Society.'
</p>

<p>
'What do you mean, sir?' demanded his
father.
</p>

<p>
'What a writer says.'
</p>

<p>
'And what the devil does he say?'
</p>

<p>
'That "love seems such a poor and
contemptible thing in their eyes in comparison
with settlements.  Perhaps they forget their
own youth; one does, they say, when he
outlives romance.  And I suppose bread and
butter is better than poetry any day."'
</p>

<p>
'I should think so.'
</p>

<p>
'We had other and brilliant views for you,'
said his mother in a tone of intense
mortification, 'but now&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Leave us and begone, and let us look
upon your face no more,' interrupted his
father in a voice of indescribable sternness,
almost hoarse with passion, as he pointed to
the door.
</p>

<p>
'Mother!' said Lennard appealingly, 'oh,
mother!'  But she averted her face, cold as a
woman of ice, and said, 'Go!'
</p>

<p>
'So be it,' replied Lennard, gravely and
sadly, as he drew himself up to the full height
of his five feet ten inches, and a handsome
and comely fellow he looked as he turned
away and left the room.
</p>

<p>
'Thank God, his elder brother, Cosmo, is
yet left to us!' exclaimed Lady Fettercairn
earnestly.
</p>

<p>
It was the last time in this life he ever
heard his mother's voice, and he quitted the
house.  On the terrace without, carefully he
knocked the ashes out of his cherished briar-root,
put it with equal care into its velvet-lined
case, put the case into his pocket, and
walked slowly off with a grim and resolute
expression in his fine young face, upon which
from that day forth his father and mother
never looked again.
</p>

<p>
Then he was thinking chiefly of the sweet
face of the young girl who had united her
fortunes with his, and who was anxiously
awaiting the result of the interview we have
described.
</p>

<p>
Sorrow, mortification, and no small
indignation were in the heart of Lennard Melfort
at the result of the late interview.
</p>

<p>
'I have been rash,' he thought, 'in marrying
poor Flora without their permission, but that
they would never have accorded, even had
they seen her; and none fairer or more
beautiful ever came as a bride to Craigengowan.'
</p>

<p>
Pausing, he gave a long and farewell look
at the house so named&mdash;the home of his boyhood.
</p>

<p>
It stands at some distance from the Valley
of the Dee (which forms the natural
communication between the central Highlands
and the fertile Lowlands) in the Hollow or
Howe of the Mearns.  Situated amid
luxuriant woods, glimpses of Craigengowan
obtained from the highway only excite curiosity
without gratifying it, but a nearer approach
reveals its picturesque architectural features.
</p>

<p>
These are the elements common to most
northern mansions that are built in the old
Scottish style&mdash;a multitude of conical turrets,
steep crowstepped gables and dormer gablets,
encrusted with the monograms and armorial
bearings of the race who were its lords when
the family of Fettercairn were hewers of wood
and drawers of water.
</p>

<p>
The turrets rise into kindred forms in the
towers and gables, and are the gradual
accumulation of additions made at various times
on the original old square tower, rather than
a part of the original design, but the effect of
the whole is extremely rich and picturesque.
</p>

<p>
In the old Scottish garden was an ancient
sun and moon dial, mossy and grey, by which
many a lover had reckoned the time in the
days of other years.
</p>

<p>
Of old, Craigengowan belonged to an exiled
and attainted Jacobite family, from whom it
passed readily enough into the hands of the
second Lord Fettercairn, a greedy and
unscrupulous Commissioner on the forfeited
estates of the unfortunate loyalists.  It had
now many modern comforts and appliances;
the entrance-hall was a marble-paved apartment,
off which the principal sitting-rooms
opened, and now a handsome staircase led to
the upper chambers, whilom the abode of
barons who ate the beef and mutton their
neighbours fed in the valley of the Dee.
</p>

<p>
The grounds were extensive and beautiful,
and Lord Fettercairn's flower gardens and
conservatories were renowned throughout
Angus and the Mearns.
</p>

<p>
To the bitter storm that existed in his own
breast, and that which he had left in those of
his parents, how peaceful by contrast looked
the old house and the summer scenery to
Lennard&mdash;the place on which he probably
would never gaze again.
</p>

<p>
There was a breeze that rustled the green
leaves in the thickets, but no wind.  Beautiful
and soft white clouds floated lazily in the
deep blue sky, and a recent shower had
freshened up every tree, meadow, and
hedgerow.  The full-eared wheat grew red or
golden by the banks of the Bervie, and the
voice of the cushat dove came from the
autumn woods from time to time as with a
sigh Lennard Melfort turned his back on
Craigengowan for ever, cursing, as he went,
the pride of his family, for, though not an
old one, by title or territory, they were as
proud as they were unscrupulous in politics.
</p>

<p>
The first prominent member of the family,
Lennard Melfort, had been a Commissioner
for the Mearns in the Scottish Parliament,
and for political services had been raised to
the peerage by Queen Anne as Lord Fettercairn
and Strathfinella, and was famous for
nothing but selling his Union vote for the
same sum as my Lord Abercairnie, £500,
and for having afterwards 'a rug at the
compensation,' as the English equivalent money
was called.  After the battle of Sheriffmuir
saw half the old peerages of Scotland
attainted, he obtained Craigengowan, and was
one 'who,' as the minister of Inverbervie
said, 'wad sell his soul to the deil for a
crackit saxpence.'
</p>

<p>
With the ex-Commissioner the talent&mdash;such
as it was&mdash;of the race ended, and for three
generations the Lords of Fettercairn had
been neither better nor worse than peers
of Scotland generally; that is, they were
totally oblivious of the political interests of
that country, and of everything but their own
self-aggrandisement by marriage or otherwise.
</p>

<p>
Lennard Melfort seemed the first of the
family that proved untrue to its old instincts.
</p>

<p>
'And I had made up my mind that he
should marry Lady Drumshoddy's daughter&mdash;she
has a splendid fortune!' wailed Lady
Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'Married my governess&mdash;the girl MacIan!'
snorted my Lady Drumshoddy when she
heard of the dreadful mésalliance.  'Why
marry the creature?  He might love her, of
course&mdash;all men are alike weak&mdash;but to marry
her&mdash;oh, no!'
</p>

<p>
And my Lady Drumshoddy was a very
moral woman according to her standard, and
carried her head very high.
</p>

<p>
When tidings were bruited abroad of what
happened, and the split in the family circle at
Craigengowan, there were equal sorrow and
indignation expressed in the servants' hall,
the gamekeepers' lodges, and the home farm,
for joyous and boyish Captain Melfort was a
favourite with all on the Fettercairn estates;
and Mrs. Prim, his mother's maid, actually
shed many tears over the untoward fate he
had brought upon himself.

CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
WEDDED.
</h3>

<p>
'And you will love me still, Flora, in spite
of this bitter affront to which you are
subjected for my sake?' said Lennard.
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said the girl passionately, 'I love
you, Lennard&mdash;love you so much,' she added,
while her soft voice broke and her blossom-like
lips quivered, 'that were I to lose you I
would die!'
</p>

<p>
'My darling, you cannot lose me now,' he
responded, while tenderly caressing her.
</p>

<p>
'Are we foolish to talk in this fashion,
Lennard?'
</p>

<p>
'Foolish?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;or rash.  I have heard that it is
not lucky for people to love each other so
much as we do.'
</p>

<p>
'Could we love each other less?'
</p>

<p>
'I don't think so,' said she simply and
sweetly, as he laid her cheek on his breast
with her upturned eyes gazing into his.
</p>

<p>
The girl was slight and slender, yet perfect
was every curve of her shapely figure, which
was destitute of any straight line; even her
nose was, in the slightest degree, aquiline.
Her beautifully arched mouth, the scarlet
line of her upper lip, and the full round of
the nether one were parted in a tender
smile, just enough to show her teeth, defied
all criticism; her complexion was pure and
soft, and her eyes were of the most liquid
hazel, with almost black lashes.  Her hair
was of the same tint, and Flora seemed a
lady to perfection, especially by the whiteness
and delicacy of her beautifully shaped little
hands.
</p>

<p>
When she walked she did so gracefully, as
all Highland women do, and like them held
her head poised on her slender neck so
airily and prettily that her nurse, Madelon,
called her 'the swan.'
</p>

<p>
'How I trembled, Lennard,' said she,
after a pause, 'as I thought of the <i>mauvais
quart d'heure</i> you were undergoing at Craigengowan.'
</p>

<p>
'It was a <i>mauvais</i> hour and more, darling.'
</p>

<p>
'And ever and anon I felt that strange
chill, or shudder, which Nurse Madelon says
people feel when some one crosses the place
where their grave is to be.  How can your
parents be so cruel to you?'
</p>

<p>
'And to you, Flora!'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, that is different,' she replied, with
her eyes full of unshed tears, and in a pained
voice.  'Doubtless they consider me a very
designing girl; but in spite of that, you
will always care for me as much as you do now?'
</p>

<p>
'Why such fears?  Ever and always&mdash;ever
and always, my darling,' said Lennard
Melfort, stopping her questioning lips most
effectually for a time.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, if you should ever come to regret,
and with regret to love me less!' said she,
in a low voice, with her eyes for a moment
fixed on vacancy.
</p>

<p>
'Why that boding thought, Flora?'
</p>

<p>
'Because, surely, such great love never lasts.'
</p>

<p>
He kissed her again as the readiest response.
</p>

<p>
But the sequel proved that his great love
outlasted her own life, poor girl!
</p>

<p>
Then they sat long silent, hand locked in
hand, while the gloaming deepened round
them, for words seem poor and feeble when
the heart is very full.
</p>

<p>
'How long will they continue to despise
me?' said Flora suddenly, while across her
soft cheeks there rushed the hot blood of a
long and gallant line of Celtic ancestors.
</p>

<p>
An exclamation of bitterness&mdash;almost
impatience, escaped Lennard.
</p>

<p>
'Let us forget them&mdash;father, mother, all!' said he.
</p>

<p>
The girl looked passionately into the face
of her lover-husband&mdash;the husband of a
month; and never did her bright hazel eyes
seem more tender and soft than now, with
all the fire of love and pride sparkling in
their depths, for her Highland spirit and
nature revolted at the affront to which she
was subjected.
</p>

<p>
The bearing of Lennard Melfort and the
poise of his close-shorn head told that he was
a soldier, and a well-drilled one; and the
style of his light grey suit showed how
thoroughly he was a gentleman; and to
Flora's loving and partial eye he was
every-way a model man.
</p>

<p>
They had been married just a month, we
have said, a month that very day, and
Lennard had brought his bride to the little
burgh town, within a short distance of
Craigengowan, and left her in their apartments
while he sought with his father and mother
the bootless interview just narrated.
</p>

<p>
For three days before he had the courage
to bring it about, they had spent the time
together, full of hopeful thoughts, strolling
along the banks of the pretty Bervie, from
the blue current of which ever and anon the
bull-trout and the salmon rise to the flies; or
in the deep and leafy recourses of the
adjacent woods, and climbing the rugged
coast, against which the waves of the German
Sea were rolling in golden foam; or ascending
Craig David, so called from David II. of
Scotland&mdash;a landmark from the sea for
fifteen leagues&mdash;for both had a true and
warm appreciation and artistic love of Nature
in all her moods and aspects.
</p>

<p>
The sounds of autumn were about them
now; the hum of insects and the song of the
few birds that yet sang; the fragrance of the
golden broom and the sweet briar, with a
score of other sweet and indefinable scents
and balmy breaths.  All around them was
scenic beauty and peace, and yet with all
their great love for each other, their hearts
were heavy at the prospect of their future,
which must be a life of banishment in India,
and to the heaviness of Lennard was added
indignation and sorrow.  But he could
scarcely accuse himself of having acted
rashly in the matter of his marriage, for to
that his family would never have consented;
and he often thought could his mother but
see Flora in her beauty and brightness,
looking so charming in her smart sealskin and
bewitching cap and feather, and long skirt of
golden-brown silk that matched her hair and
eyes&mdash;every way a most piquante-looking
girl!
</p>

<p>
Young though he was, and though a
second son, Lennard Melfort had been a
favourite with more than one Belgravian
belle and her mamma, and there were few
who had not something pleasant or complimentary
to say of him since his return from
India.  At balls, fêtes, garden and water
parties, girls had given him the preference
to many who seemed more eligible, had
reserved for him dances on their programmes,
sang for him, made unmistakable <i>œillades</i>,
and so forth; for his handsome figure and his
position made him very acceptable, though
he had not the prospects of his elder brother,
the Hon. Cosmo.
</p>

<p>
Lady Fettercairn knew how Lennard was
regarded and valued well, and nourished
great hopes therefrom; but this was all over
and done with now.
</p>

<p>
To her it seemed as if he had thrown his
very life away, and that when his marriage
with a needy governess&mdash;however beautiful
and well born she might be&mdash;became known,
all that charmed and charming circle in
Belgravia and Tyburnia would regard him as
a black sheep indeed; would shake their
aristocratic heads, and pity poor Lord and
Lady Fettercairn for having such a renegade
son.
</p>

<p>
Flora's chief attendant&mdash;a Highland woman
who had nursed her in infancy&mdash;was comically
vituperative and indignant at the affront put
by these titled folks upon 'her child' as she
called her.
</p>

<p>
Madelon Galbraith was strong, healthy,
active, and only in her fortieth year, with
black eyes and hair, a rich ruddy complexion,
a set of magnificent white teeth, and her
manner was full of emphatic, almost violent,
gesticulation peculiar to many Highlanders,
who seem to talk with their hands and arms
quite as much as the tongue.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Madelon spoke in her native
Gaelic, but generally in the dialect of the
Lowlands.
</p>

<p>
'Set them up indeed,' she muttered; 'wha
are the Melforts o' Fettercairn, that they
should slight you&mdash;<i>laoghe mo chri</i>?' she
added, softly (calf of my heart).  'What a
pity it is ye canna fling at their heads the
gold they love, for even a Lowland dog winna
yowl gin ye pelt him wi' banes.  But you've
begun wi' love and marriage, and a gude
beginning mak's a gude ending.'
</p>

<p>
'But we shall be so poor, Nursie Madelon,
and I have ruined my poor Lennard,' urged
Flora, as the kind woman caressed her.
</p>

<p>
'They say a kiss and a cup of water mak'
but a wersh breakfast,' laughed Madelon; 'but
you're no sae puir as that comes to, my
darling.'
</p>

<p>
'Not quite' said Flora, laughing faintly, in
turn.  'Yet I have sorely injured my
husband's prospects.'
</p>

<p>
'Tut, tut, my bairn.  Ony man can woo,
but he weds only whar his weird lies; and so
Captain Melfort wedded you, and wha better?
Then what is a Lord that we should <i>lippen</i> to
<i>him</i>?  As long as ye serve a tod ye maun
carry his tail?  And your father's daughter
may carry her head wi' the highest.'
</p>

<p>
Lennard Melfort now resolved neither
verbally nor by letter to have further
intercourse with his family at Craigengowan or
elsewhere, but before he could make up his
mind what to do or could betake him south,
as he meant to quit Scotland without delay,
on the day subsequent to the stormy interview
Madelon announced a visitor, and on a
salver brought in a card inscribed&mdash;'MR. KENNETH
KIPPILAW, W.S.'
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
THE SPURNED OFFER.
</h3>

<p>
'The family agent from Edinburgh, Flora,'
said Lennard, in answer to her inquiring
glance.  'Mrs. Melfort,' he added, introducing
her to their visitor, who bowed with a
critical glance and appreciative smile.
</p>

<p>
'I have been telegraphed for by your
father, Captain Melfort,' said Mr. Kippilaw,
as they shook hands and he was motioned to
a chair.
</p>

<p>
A hale, hearty, unpretentious, business-like
man, about forty years of age, Mr. Kenneth
Kippilaw was too well-bred and too sensible
to begin the matter in hand by any remarks
about youthful imprudence, early marriages,
or so forth, as he knew the pride and
temperament of the young man before him, but
laid down his hat, and, after some of that
familiar weather talk which is the invariable
prelude to any conversation over all the
British Isles, he gently approached the object
of his mission, which Flora, in the simplicity
and terror of her heart, never doubted was a
separation of some kind between herself and
Lennard, so with a pallid face she bowed and
withdrew.
</p>

<p>
'To what am I indebted for the pleasure
of this&mdash;a&mdash;unexpected interview?' asked
Lennard, a little stiffly.
</p>

<p>
'Instructions just received from your father,
Captain Melfort.'
</p>

<p>
'Then you have come from Craigengowan?'
</p>

<p>
'Straight.'
</p>

<p>
'Has he made up his mind to accept my
wife as his daughter-in-law?'
</p>

<p>
'Quite the reverse, I regret to say.'
</p>

<p>
Lennard's face darkened with indignation,
and he gave his moustache an angry twist.
</p>

<p>
'Are my father and mother determined to
ignore the fact that she is a lady by birth?'
asked Lennard after a gloomy pause.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;they know, of course, that she is a
lady,' stammered Mr. Kippilaw, feeling his
mission an ungracious one, 'but poor&mdash;one
who has sunk into obscurity and dependence&mdash;pardon
me, I but use their own identical words.
</p>

<p>
'Well?'
</p>

<p>
'What is done in this instance unfortunately
cannot be undone, Captain Melfort;
but his lordship, feeling, of course, keenly in
the matter, is willing to continue your allowance,
and even to double it, on one condition.
</p>

<p>
'Name it.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw sighed, for though, as a
lawyer, considerably hardened, he felt the
delicacy of the whole situation, and Lennard's
dark eyes seemed to focus and pierce him.
</p>

<p>
'The condition&mdash;to the point!'
</p>

<p>
'Is&mdash;that you will return to India&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'I mean to do so forthwith,' interrupted
Lennard sharply.
</p>

<p>
'Or you may live anywhere out of Britain,
but never attempt to intrude Mrs. Melfort
upon your family or their circle, and contrive,
if possible, to let that circle forget your existence.'
</p>

<p>
'Insolent&mdash;and cruel as insolent!' exclaimed
Lennard Melfort as he started from
his chair and paced about the room, with his
dark eyes flashing and the veins in his
forehead swollen like whip-cord.
</p>

<p>
'The words I speak are not my own,' said
Mr. Kippilaw, deprecatingly.
</p>

<p>
'Return to Craigengowan, and tell my
father that I reject his bribe to insult my
wife&mdash;for a bribe it is&mdash;with the scorn it merits.
Not a penny of his money will I accept while
my sword and pay, or life itself, are left me.
Tell Lord and Lady Fettercairn that I view
myself as their son no more.  As they
discard me, so do I discard them; and even
their <i>very name</i> I shall not keep&mdash;remember that!'
</p>

<p>
'Dear me&mdash;dear me, all this is very sad!'
</p>

<p>
'They have thrust me from them as if I
had been guilty of a crime&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Melfort!'
</p>

<p>
'A crime I say&mdash;yet a day may come
when they will repent it; and from this hour
I swear&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Not in anger,' interrupted Mr. Kippilaw,
entreatingly; 'take no hasty vow in your
present temper.'
</p>

<p>
'I swear that to them and theirs I shall
be&mdash;from this hour&mdash;as one in the grave!'
</p>

<p>
'But,' urged the lawyer, 'but suppose&mdash;which
God forbid&mdash;that aught happened to
your elder brother, Mr. Cosmo Melfort?'
</p>

<p>
'I wish Cosmo well; but I care not for my
interest in the title&mdash;it may become dormant,
extinct, for aught that I care.  Neither I nor
any of mine shall ever claim it, nor shall I
again set foot in Craigengowan, or on the
lands around it&mdash;no, never again, never again!'
</p>

<p>
To every argument of the kind-hearted
Mr. Kippilaw, who really loved the Fettercairn
family and esteemed the high-spirited
Lennard, the latter turned a deaf ear.
</p>

<p>
He departed in despair of softening matters
between the rash son and indignant parents.
To them he greatly modified the nature of
the useless interview, but they heard of
Lennard's determination with perfect unconcern,
and even with a grim smile of contempt,
never doubting that when money pressure
came upon him they would find him at their
mercy.  But that time never came.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw returned to Edinburgh, and
there the affair seemed to end.
</p>

<p>
The parting words of Lord Fettercairn to
him were said smilingly and loftily:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'The French have a little phrase, which in
six words expresses all our experiences in life.'
</p>

<p>
'And this phrase, my lord?'
</p>

<p>
'Is simply&mdash;<i>tout passe, tout casse, tout
lasse</i>&mdash;that we outlive everything in turn and in
time&mdash;and so this matter of Lennard's pride
will be a matter of time only.  Be assured
we shall outlive the indignation of our
misguided son.'
</p>

<p>
'But will you outlive your own?'
</p>

<p>
'Never!'
</p>

<p>
'I can but hope that you will, my lord.
Remember the hackneyed quotation from
Pope&mdash;"To err is human, to forgive divine."
</p>

<p>
'I never forgive!' replied his lordship bitterly.
</p>

<p>
The name of Lennard was never uttered
again by his parents, nor even by his brother
Cosmo (then reading up at Oxford) till the
hour for forgiveness was past; and even
Cosmo they contrived to innoculate with
their own cruel and unchristian sentiment of
hostility.  Lennard's portrait was removed
from its place of honour in the dining-hall,
and banished to the lumber-attic; the goods,
chattels, and mementoes he left at home were
scattered and dispersed; even his horses were
sold, and the saddles he had used; and the
Fettercairn family would&mdash;could they have
done so&mdash;have obliterated his name from the
great double-columned tome of Sir Bernard
Burke.
</p>

<p>
Heedless of all that, the young husband
and his dark-eyed girl-wife were all the world
to each other.
</p>

<p>
'After mamma followed papa to the grave,
Lennard&mdash;for she never held up her head
after she heard of his death at Khooshab,'
said Flora, as she nestled her head in his
neck, 'I seemed to be condemned to a life of
hardship, humiliation, and heartlessness, till
I met you, dearest.  I felt that even the love
of some dumb animal&mdash;a dog or a horse&mdash;was
better than the entire absence of affection
in the narrow circle of my life.  I did so long
for something or some one to love me
exclusively&mdash;I felt so miserably, so utterly alone
in the world.  Now I have you&mdash;<i>you</i> to love
me.  But in winning you I have robbed you
of the love of all your people.'
</p>

<p>
'Talk not of it, and think not of it, dearest
Flora.  We are now more than ever all in
all to each other.'
</p>

<p>
The money bribe, offered in such a way
and for such a purpose, exasperated Lennard
still more against his family, and drew many
a tear of humiliation from Flora in secret.
</p>

<p>
She thought that she had wrought Lennard
a great wrong by winning his love for herself,
and she was now burning with impatience to
turn her back on the shores of Britain and
find a new home in India; and there, by staff
or other employments and allowances, Lennard
knew that he could gain more than the
yearly sum his father so mortifyingly offered him.
</p>

<p>
Flora wept much over it all, we say, and
her appetite became impaired; but she did
not&mdash;like the heroine of a three-volume
novel&mdash;starve herself into a fright.
</p>

<p>
But a short time before she had been a
childish and simple maiden&mdash;one sorely tried,
however, and crushed by evil fortune; but
with Lennard Melfort now, 'the prince had
come into her existence and awakened her
soul, and she was a woman&mdash;innocent
still&mdash;but yet a woman.'
</p>

<p>
The scenery of the Mearns looked inexpressibly
lovely in the purity and richness of
its verdure and varied artistic views, for the
woods were profusely tinted with gold, russet
brown, and red, when Lennard Melfort turned
his back upon it and his native home for
ever!
</p>

<p>
The birds were chirping blithly, and the
voice of the corncraik, with
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The sweet strain that the corn-reapers sang,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
came on the evening breeze together.  The
old kirk bell was tolling in the distance, and
its familiar sound spoke to Lennard's heart
of home like that of an old friend.  The river
was rolling under its great arch of some eighty
feet in span, the downward reflection of the
latter in the water making a complete circle
like a giant O.  The old castle of Halgreen,
with its loopholed battlements of the
fourteenth century, stood blackly and boldly upon
its wave-beaten eminence, and the blue smoke
of picturesque Gourdon, a fisher village, curled
up on the ambient air, as the scenery faded
out in the distance.
</p>

<p>
Flora became marvellously cheerful when
their journey fairly began, and laughingly she
sung in Lennard's ear&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'The world goes up and the world goes down,<br />
  But <i>yesterday's</i> smile and <i>yesterday's</i> frown<br />
  Can never come back again, sweet friend&mdash;<br />
  Can never come back again!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Means were not forgotten to support nurse
Madelon in her native place, where we shall
leave her till she reappears in our narrative
again.
</p>

<p>
So Lennard and his girl-wife sailed for
India, full of love for each other and hope for
their own lonely and unaided future, and both
passed for ever out of the lives and apparently
out of the memory of the family at Craigengowan.
</p>

<p>
Times there were when he hoped to distinguish
himself, so that the circle there&mdash;those
who had renounced him&mdash;would be
proud of him; but in seeking that distinction
rashly, he might throw away his life, and thus
leave his little Flora penniless on the mercy
of a cold world and a proverbially ungrateful
Government.
</p>

<p>
But they could not forget home, and many
a time and oft, where the sun-baked cantonments
of Meerut seemed to vibrate under the
fierce light of the Indian sun, where the
temples of Hurdwar from their steep of marble
steps look down upon the Ganges, or where
the bungalows of Cawnpore or Etwah,
garlanded with fragrant jasmine, stand by the
rolling Jumna amid glorious oleanders and
baubool trees, with their golden balls loading
the air with perfume, while the giant heron
stalked by the river's bed, the alligator basked
in the ooze, and the Brahmin ducks floated
overhead, Flora's sweet voice made Lennard's
heart thrill as she sang to him the songs of
the land they had resolved never to look
upon again, even when that sound so stirring
to the most sluggish Scottish breast when far
away, the pipes of a Highland regiment,
poured their notes on the hot sunny air.
</p>

<p>
At home none seemed to care or think of
the discarded son but the worthy lawyer
Kenneth Kippilaw, who had loved him as a
lad, and could not get his hard fate out of his
mind.
</p>

<p>
From time to time, inspired by kindness
and curiosity, he watched his name among the
captains in the military lists of that thick
compendium which no Scottish business
establishment is ever without&mdash;'Oliver and
Boyd's Almanack.'  Therein, after a while,
the name of Lennard Melfort <i>disappeared</i>,
but whether he was dead, had sold out, or
'gone to the bad,' the worthy Writer to the
Signet could not discover, and he not
unnaturally sighed over what he deemed a lost
life.
</p>

<p>
And here we end that which is a species of
prologue to our story.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap04"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
REVELSTOKE COTTAGE.
</h3>

<p>
More than twenty years had elapsed after
the episodes we have described, and Lennard
and Flora had found a new home, and she,
her <i>last one</i>, more than four hundred and
fifty miles as the crow flies from where
Craigengowan looks down on the German
Sea.  But none that looked on Lennard
Melfort now would have recognised in the
prematurely aged man the handsome young
fellow who in ire and disgust had quitted his
native land.
</p>

<p>
In two years after he had gone eastward a
dreadful fever, contracted in a place where
he had volunteered on a certain duty to
gain money for the support of his wife and
her little Indian establishment&mdash;the Terrai of
Nepaul, that miasmatic border of prairie which
lies along the great forest of the Himalayas,
and has an evil repute even among the
natives of the country in the wet season when
the leaves are falling.
</p>

<p>
This fever broke Lennard's health completely,
and so changed him that his rich
brown hair and moustache were grey at
six-and-twenty, and ere long he looked like a
man of twice his age.
</p>

<p>
'Can that fellow really be Lennard Melfort
of the Fusiliers?  Why, he is a veritable
Knight of the Rueful Countenance!'
exclaimed some old friends who saw him at
'The Rag,' when he came home to seek a
place of quiet and seclusion in Devonshire, as
it subsequently chanced to be.
</p>

<p>
Amid the apple bowers of the land of cider,
and near a beautiful little bay into which the
waters of the British Channel rippled, stood
the pretty and secluded cottage he occupied,
as 'Major MacIan,' with his son and a
nephew.
</p>

<p>
The wooded hills around it were not all
covered with orchards, however, and the little
road that wound round the bay ran under
eminences that, from their aspect, might make
a tourist think he was skirting a Swiss lake.
Others were heath-clad and fringed at the
base by a margin of grey rocks.
</p>

<p>
Into the bay flowed a stream, blue and
transparent always.  Here salmon trout were
often found, and the young men spent hours
at its estuary angling for rock fish.
</p>

<p>
A Devonshire cottage is said by Mrs. Bray
to be 'the sweetest object that the poet, the
artist, or the lover of the romantic could
desire to see,' and such a cottage was that of
Major MacIan, the name now adopted by
Lennard&mdash;that of Flora's father&mdash;in fulfilment
of the vow he had made to renounce the
name, title, and existence of his family.
</p>

<p>
Around it, and in front sloping down to
the bay, was a beautiful garden, teeming with
the flowers and fruits of Devonshire.  On
three sides was a rustic verandah, the trellis
work of which was covered by a woven
clematis, sweetbriar, and Virginia creeper,
which, in the first year of her residence there,
Flora's pretty hands, cased in garden gloves,
were never tired of tending; and now the
Virginia creeper, with its luxuriant tendrils,
emerald green in summer, russet and red in
autumn, grew in heavy masses over the roof
and around the chimney stalks, making it, as
Flora was wont to say exultingly, 'quite a
love of a place!'
</p>

<p>
On one hand lay the rolling waters of the
Channel, foaming about the Mewstone Rock;
on the other, a peep was given amid the
coppice of the ancient church of Revelstoke,
and here the married pair lived happily and
alone for a brief time.
</p>

<p>
Save for the advent of a ship passing in
sight of the little bay, it was a sleepy place
in which Lennard, now retired as a major,
had 'pitched his tent,' as he said&mdash;the Cottage
of Revelstoke.  Even in these railway times
people thereabout were content with yesterday's
news.  There was no gas to spoil the
complexions of the young, and no water rates
to 'worrit' the old; and telegrams never
came, in their orange-tinted envelopes, to
startle the hearts of the feeble and the sickly.
</p>

<p>
No monetary transactions having taken
place, and no correspondence being necessary,
between Lennard and his family or their
legal agent, Mr. Kippilaw, for more than
twenty years now, he had quite passed away
from their knowledge, and almost from their
memory; and many who knew them once
cared not, perhaps, whether he or his wife
were in the land of the living.
</p>

<p>
A son, we have said, had been born to
them, and Lennard named the child Florian,
after his mother (here again ignoring his own
family), whom that event cost dear, for the
sweet and loving Flora never recovered her
health or strength&mdash;injured, no doubt, in
India&mdash;but fell into a decline, and, two years
after, passed away in the arms of Lennard
and her old nurse, Madelon.
</p>

<p>
Lonely, lonely indeed, did the former feel
now, though an orphan nephew of Flora&mdash;the
son of her only sister&mdash;came to reside
with him&mdash;Shafto Gyle by name&mdash;one who
will figure largely in our story.
</p>

<p>
Would Lennard ever forget the day of her
departure, when she sank under that wasting
illness with which no doctor could grapple?
Ever and always he could recall the sweet
but pallid face, the white, wasted hands, the
fever-lighted dark eyes, which seemed so
unnaturally large when, after one harrowing
night of pain and delirium, she became gentle
and quiet, and lovingly told him to take a
little rest&mdash;for old-looking he was; old, worn,
and wasted far beyond his years&mdash;and he
obeyed her, saying he would take a little
turn in the garden among the roses&mdash;the
roses her hands would tend no more&mdash;sick
at heart with the closeness of the sick-chamber
and all it suggested, and maddened by the
loud ticking of the watchful doctor's repeater
as it lay on a table littered with useless
phials; and how, ere he had been ten minutes
in the sunny morning air, amid the perfume
of the roses, he was wildly summoned by
Madelon Galbraith with white cheeks and
affrighted eyes, back to the chamber of
death it proved to be; for it was on the
brow of Death he pressed his passionate
kisses, and to ears that could hear no more
he uttered his heartrending entreaties that
she would not leave him, or would give him
one farewell word; and ever after would the
perfume of roses be associated in his mind
with that morning&mdash;the most terrible one of
his life!
</p>

<p>
Beside Revelstoke Church&mdash;old, picturesque,
and rendered comely by a wealth
of luxuriant ivy that Time has wreathed
around its hoary walls to flutter in the sea
breeze&mdash;she was laid, and the heart of
Lennard seemed to be buried with her.
</p>

<p>
It is a lonely old building, spotted with
lichens, worn by storms, and perched upon
the verge of a low, rocky cliff, up which the
salt spray comes at times to the
burial-ground.  It is near the end of Mothcombe
Bay, where the shore makes a turn to the
southward.
</p>

<p>
Not a house is near it, the solitary hills
and waves encompass it, and it is said that
its smouldering tombstones would furnish
ample matter for the 'meditations' of a
Hervey.  So there Flora was laid, and there
Lennard was to be laid by her side when the
time came.
</p>

<p>
Her death hardened his heart more than
ever against his own family, and he began
almost to forget that he ever bore any other
name than hers&mdash;his adopted one.
</p>

<p>
In the kindness of his heart the major, as
the lads&mdash;his son and nephew&mdash;grew up
together, introduced both to neighbours and
strangers equally as his sons, but most
unwisely, as we shall ere long have to record.
</p>

<p>
Neither to Florian nor to Shafto Gyle did
he reveal his real name, or the story of the
quarrel with his family and their work; thus
in and about Revelstoke all three passed
under the name of MacIan now.
</p>

<p>
Madelon Galbraith, who had attended her
mistress on her death-bed, and nursed her
baby into boyhood, had now gone back to
her native glen in the wilds of Ross.  She
proved, Lennard found, somewhat unfitted
for the locality of Revelstoke, as her ways
and ideas were foreign to those of the folks
thereabouts; but she will have a prominent
place in our story in the future.
</p>

<p>
But long, long Madelon wept over Florian,
and pressed him often to her breast&mdash;'the
baby of her bairn,' as she had called
him&mdash;for as she had nursed him, so had she nursed
his mother before him in the days when the
victorious Ross-shire Buffs set up their tents
at Khooshab, on the plains of Persia.
</p>

<p>
'Gude-by, calf of my heart,' were her parting
words; 'I'll see ye yet again, Florian.
If it were na for hope, the heart wad break!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
DULCIE.
</h3>

<p>
All trace of Lennard Melfort had been
obliterated at Craigengowan, we have said.
He was never mentioned there, and though
his family tried to think of him as dead, they
did not quite succeed; but the disappearance
of his name from the Army List first excited
a little speculation, but no inquiry, until a
terrible event occurred.
</p>

<p>
The eldest son, the Hon. Cosmo, married
the daughter of Lady Drumshoddy, thus
securing her thousands, and did his best to
console Lord and Lady Fettercairn for 'the
disgrace' brought upon them by Lennard,
and they regarded him quite as a model son.
</p>

<p>
He shone as Chairman at all kinds of
county meetings; became M.P. for a cluster
of northern burghs, and was a typical Scottish
member, mightily interested when such grand
Imperial matters as the gravelling of Park
Lane, the ducks on the Serpentine, and the
improvements at Hyde Park Corner were
before the House, but was oblivious of all
Scottish interests, or that such a place as
Scotland existed.  When she wanted&mdash;like
other parts of the empire&mdash;but never got
them&mdash;grants for necessary purposes, the
Hon. Cosmo was mute as a fish, or if he
spoke it was to record his vote against them.
</p>

<p>
Lennard saw in a chance newspaper, and
with natural grief and dismay, that Cosmo
had come to an untimely end when deer-stalking
near Glentilt.  He had wounded a
large stag, the captain of its herd, and
approached rashly or incautiously when the
infuriated animal was at bay.  It broke its
bay, attacked him in turn, and ere the great
shaggy hounds could tear it down, Cosmo
was trampled under foot and gored to death
by its horns.
</p>

<p>
As Lennard read, his sad mind went to the
scene where that death must have happened,
under mighty Ben-y-gloe, where the kestrel
builds his nest and the great mountain eagle
has his eyry, and the Tilt comes thundering
down over its precipices of grey rock.  Never
again would his eyes rest on such glorious
scenes as these.
</p>

<p>
Cosmo had left a little daughter, Finella,
who took up her abode with her grandparents
at Craigengowan, but no son, and
Lennard knew that by this tragedy he was
now the heir to the peerage, but he only gave
a bitter sigh as he thought of Flora in her
grave and made no sign.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Cosmo,' he muttered, and forgetting
for a time much that had occurred, and how
completely Cosmo had leagued with father
and mother against him, his memory went
back to the pleasant days of their happy
boyhood, when they rode, fished, and shot
together, shared the same bedroom in Craigengowan,
and conned their tasks from the same books.
</p>

<p>
'Well, well,' he added, 'all that is over
and done with long, long ago.'
</p>

<p>
He made no sign, we say, but let time pass
by, not foreseeing the complications that were
eventually to arise by his doing so.
</p>

<p>
Florian, born two years after the adoption
of Shafto Gyle in his infancy, always regarded
and looked up to the latter as a species of
elder brother and undoubted senior.
</p>

<p>
In his twentieth year Florian was really a
handsome fellow, and if, without absurdity,
the term 'beautiful' could be applied to a
young man, he was so, in his perfect manliness.
Tall in figure, hard and well developed
in muscle, regular in features, he had clear,
dark, honest eyes, with lashes like a girl's,
and a dark, silky moustache.
</p>

<p>
Shafto's face was in some respects handsome
too, but an evil one to look at, in one
way.  His fair eyebrows were heavy, and
had a way of meeting in a dark frown when
he was thinking.  His pale grey eyes were
shifty, and were given him, like his tongue,
to conceal rather than express his thoughts,
for they were sharp and cunning.  His
nostrils were delicate, and, like his thin lips,
suggestive of cruelty, while his massive jaw
and thick neck were equally so&mdash;we must say
almost to brutality.
</p>

<p>
They were rather a contrast, these two
young men&mdash;a contrast no less great in their
dispositions and minds than in their outward
appearance.  They were so dissimilar&mdash;one
being dark and the other fair&mdash;that no one
would have taken them for brothers, as they
were generally supposed to be, so affectionate
was the Major to both, and both bearing his
name in the locality.
</p>

<p>
As a schoolboy Shafto had won an unpleasant
reputation for jockeying his companions,
'doing' them out of toys, sweetmeats,
marbles, and money, and for skilfully shifting
punishments on the wrong shoulders when
opportunity offered, and not unfrequently on
those of the unsuspecting Florian.
</p>

<p>
From some of his proclivities, the Major
thought Shafto would make a good attorney,
and so had him duly installed in the office of
Lewellen Carlyon, the nearest village lawyer,
while for his own boy, Florian, he had higher
hopes and aspirations, to make him, like
himself, a soldier; but though far from idle,
or lacking application, Florian failed, under
the insane high-pressure system of 'cramming,'
to pass, and not a few&mdash;Shafto particularly&mdash;laid
it to the account of a certain
damsel, Dulcie by name, who was supposed,
with some truth, to occupy too much of his
thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Disgusted by the result of his last 'exam.,'
Florian would at once have enlisted, like so
many others, who rush as privates for
commissions nowadays; but his father's
fast-failing health, his love for Dulcie Carlyon,
and the desperate but 'Micawber'-like hope
that 'something would turn up,' kept him
hanging on day by day aimlessly at Revelstoke,
without even the apparent future that
had opened to Shafto when elevated to a
high stool in Lawyer Carlyon's office.
</p>

<p>
As time went on, Lennard Melfort (or
MacIan as he called himself), though he had
a high appreciation of Shafto's sense, turn for
business to all appearance, cleverness, and
strength of character, turned with greater
pleasure to his own son Florian, whose clear
open brow and honest manly eyes bore
nature's unmistakable impress of a truer
nobility than ever appertained to the truculent
and anti-national lords of Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
Though to all appearance the best of
friends before the world, the cousins were
rivals; but as Florian was the successful
lover, Shafto had a good basis for bitterness,
if not secret hate.
</p>

<p>
In common with the few neighbours who
were in that sequestered quarter, the lawyer
liked the Major&mdash;he was so gentle, suave,
retiring in manner, and courteously polite.
He liked Florian too, but deemed him idle,
and there his liking ended.
</p>

<p>
He took Shafto into his office at the
Major's urgent request, as a species of
apprentice, but he&mdash;after the aphorism of
'Dr. Fell'&mdash;did not much affect the young man,
though he found him sharp enough&mdash;too
sharp at times; and, like most of the
neighbours, he never cared to inquire into the
precise relationship of the Major and the two
lads, both of whom from boyhood had called
the latter 'Papa.'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie Carlyon was the belle of the limited
circle in which she moved, and a very limited
circle it was; but she was pretty enough to
have been the belle of a much larger orbit;
for she was the very ideal of a sweet, bright
English girl, now nearly in her eighteenth
year, and the boy and girl romance in the
lives of her and Florian had lasted since they
were children and playmates together, and
they seemed now to regard each other with
'the love that is given once in a lifetime.'
</p>

<p>
'Could I but separate these two!' muttered
Shafto, as with eyes full of envy and evil he
watched one of their meetings, amid the
bushes that fringed an old quarry not far from
Revelstoke Church.
</p>

<p>
From the summit where he lurked there
was a magnificent view of the sea and the
surrounding country.  On one hand lay the
lonely old church and all the solitary hills that
overlook its wave-beaten promontory; on the
other were the white-crested waves of the
British Channel, rolling in sunshine; but
Shafto saw only the face and figure of Dulcie
Carlyon, who was clad just as he was fond of
picturing her, in a jacket of navy blue,
fastened with gilt buttons, and a skirt with
clinging folds of the same&mdash;a costume which
invests an English girl with an air equally
nautical and coquettish.  Dulcie's dresses
always fitted her exquisitely, and her small
head, with smart hat and feather, set
gracefully on her shapely shoulders, had just a
<i>soupçon</i> of pride in its contour and bearing.
</p>

<p>
Slender in figure, with that lovely flower-like
complexion which is so peculiarly English,
Dulcie had regular and delicate features, with
eyes deeply and beautifully blue,
reddish-golden hair, a laughing mouth that some
thought too large for perfect beauty, but it
was fully redeemed by its vivid colour and
faultless teeth.
</p>

<p>
'Could I but separate them!' muttered
Shafto, through his clenched teeth, while
their murmured words and mutual caresses
maddened him.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was laughingly kissing a likeness in
an open locket which Florian had just given
her&mdash;a likeness, no doubt, of himself&mdash;and
she did so repeatedly, and ever and anon
held it admiringly at arm's length.  Then she
closed it, and Florian clasped the flat silver
necklet to which it was attached round her
slender white throat; and with a bright fond
smile she concealed it among the lace frilling
of her collarette, and let the locket, for
security, drop into the cleft of her bosom,
little foreseeing the part it was yet to play in
her life.
</p>

<p>
Shafto's face would not have been pleasant
to look upon as he saw this episode, and his
shifty grey eyes grew pea-green in hue as he watched it.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Dulcie!' exclaimed Florian, with a
kind of boyish rapture, as he placed a hand
on each of her shoulders and gazed into her
eyes, 'I am most terribly in love with you.'
</p>

<p>
'Why should there be any terror in it?'
asked Dulcie, with a sweet silvery laugh.
</p>

<p>
'Well, I feel so full of joy in having your
love, and being always with you, that&mdash;that
a fear comes over me lest we should be some
day parted.'
</p>

<p>
'Who can part us but ourselves?' said she
with a pretty pout, while her long lashes
drooped.
</p>

<p>
'Dulcie,' said he, after a little pause, 'have
you ever had an emotion that comes uncalled
for&mdash;that which people call a presentiment?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes; often.'
</p>

<p>
'Has it ever come true?'
</p>

<p>
'Sometimes.'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;I have a presentiment this evening
which tells me that something is about to
happen to me&mdash;to us&mdash;and very soon too!'
</p>

<p>
'What can happen to us&mdash;we are so happy?'
said Dulcie, her blue eyes dilating.
</p>

<p>
Did the vicinity of Shafto, though unknown
to Florian, mysteriously prompt this thought&mdash;this
boding fear.  Shafto heard the words,
and a strange smile spread over his face as he
shook his clenched hand at the absorbed pair,
and stole away from his hiding-place, leaving
two foolish hearts full of a foolish dream from
which they might be roughly awakened&mdash;leaving
the happy Florian, with that sweet
and winsome Dulcie whom he loved, and
with whom he had played even as a child;
with whom he had shared many a pot of
clotted cream; with whom he had fished for
trout in the Erme and Yealm; explored with
fearful steps and awe-stricken heart the cavern
there, where lie thick the fossil bones of the
elephant, hyæna, and wolf; and wandered for
hours by the moors, among mossy rocks and
mossy trees, and in woody labyrinthine lanes,
and many a time and oft by the sea shore,
where the cliffs are upheaved and contorted in
a manner beyond description, but so loosely
bound together that waves rend them asunder,
and shape them into forms like ruined castles
and stranded ships; till, as years went on,
heart had spoken to heart; boy and girl life
had been left behind; and that dream-time
came in which they seemed to live for years.
</p>

<p>
No one could accuse Dulcie Carlyon of
coquetry, her nature was too truthful and open
for that; thus she had never for a moment
wavered in her preference between Florian
and Shafto, and spent with the former those
bright and hopeful hours that seldom come
again with the same keen intensity in a
lifetime, though often clouded by vague
doubts.
</p>

<p>
As yet they had led a kind of Paul and
Virginia life, without very defined ideas of their
future; in fact, perhaps scarcely considering
what that future might be.
</p>

<p>
They only knew, like the impassioned boy
and girl in the beautiful story of Bernardin
St. Pierre, that they loved each other very dearly,
and for the sweet present that sufficed; while
cunning Shafto Gyle looked darkly, gloomily,
and enviously on them.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps it was his fast failing health that
prevented Lennard Melfort from looking
more closely into this matter, or it may be
that he remembered the youthful love of his
own heart; for he could never forget her
whom he was so soon to join now, and who,
'after life's fitful fever,' slept by the grey wall
of Revelstoke, within sound of the restless sea.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie's father, Lawyer Carlyon, heard
rumours of these meetings and rambles, and
probably liked them as little as the Major did;
but he was a busy man absorbed in his work,
and had been used to seeing the pair together
since they were toddling children.  Lennard,
perhaps, thought it was as well to let them
alone, as nothing would come of it, while the
lawyer treated it surlily as a kind of joke.
</p>

<p>
'Why, Dulcie, my girl,' said he one day,
'what is to be the end of all this philandering
but spoiling your own market, perhaps?  Do
you expect a young fellow to marry you who
has no money, no prospects, no position in
the world?'
</p>

<p>
'Position he has,' said poor Dulcie, blushing
painfully, for though an only and motherless
child she stood in awe of her father.
</p>

<p>
'Position&mdash;a deuced bad one, I think!'
</p>

<p>
'The other two items will come in time,
papa,' said Dulcie, laughing now.
</p>

<p>
'When?'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was silent, and&mdash;for the first time in
her life&mdash;thought sadly, 'Yes, when!'  But
she pressed a pretty white hand upon the
silver locket in her bosom, as if to draw
courage therefrom as from an amulet.
</p>

<p>
'Why, lass, he can't keep even the roof of
a <i>cob</i> cottage over your head.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, papa, remember our hopeful Devonshire
proverb&mdash;a good cob, a good hat and
shoes, and a good heart last for ever.'
</p>

<p>
'Right, lass, and a good heart have you,
my darling,' said Mr. Carlyon, kissing her
peach-like cheek, for he was a kind and
good-hearted man, though somewhat rough in his
exterior, and more like a grazier than a
lawyer.  'You are both too young to know
what you are talking about.  He'll be going
away, however&mdash;can't live always on his
father, and <i>he</i>, poor fellow, won't last long.
The fancy of you both will wear itself out,
like any other summer flirtation&mdash;I had many
such in my time,' he added, with a chuckle,
'and got safely over them all.  So will you,
lass, and marry into some good family, getting
a husband that will give you a comfortable
home&mdash;for instance, Job Holbeton, with his
pits of Bovey coal.'
</p>

<p>
Poor little Dulcie shivered, and could
scarcely restrain her tears at the hard,
practical suggestions of her father.
Hard-featured, stout, and grizzled Joe Holbeton
versus her handsome Florian!
</p>

<p>
Her father spoke, too, of his probable
'going away.'  Was this the presentiment to
which her lover had referred?  It almost
seemed so.
</p>

<p>
In the sunset she went forth into the
garden to work with her wools, and even to
have a 'good cry' over what her father had
said; but in this she was prevented by
suddenly finding Shafto stretched on the grass
at her feet under a pine chestnut-tree&mdash;Shafto,
whom she could only tolerate for
Florian's sake.
</p>

<p>
'Why do you stare at me so hard, Shafto,'
she asked, with unconcealed annoyance.
</p>

<p>
'Staring, was I?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, like an owl.'
</p>

<p>
'I always like to see girls working.'
</p>

<p>
'Indeed!'
</p>

<p>
'And the work, what do you call it?'
</p>

<p>
'Crewel work.  And you like to see us busy?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, especially when the work is done by
hands so pretty and white.'
</p>

<p>
'As mine, you mean, of course?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Dulcie.  How you do bewilder a fellow!'
</p>

<p>
'Don't begin as usual to pay me clumsy
compliments, Shafto, or I shall quit the
garden,' said Dulcie, her blue eyes looking
with a half-frightened, half-defiant expression
into the keen, shifty, and pale grey ones of
Shafto, who was somewhat given to persecuting her.
</p>

<p>
He could see the outline of the locket with
every respiration of her bosom.  Could he
but possess himself of it, thought he, as he
proceeded to fill his meerschaum pipe.
</p>

<p>
'I thought gentlemen did not smoke in
ladies' society unless with permission,' said
Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
'Never bother about that, little one, please.
But may I smoke?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks; this is jolly,' said he, looking up
at her with eyes full of admiration.  'I feel
like Hercules at the feet of Omphale.'
</p>

<p>
'I don't know who he was, or what you
feel, but do you know what you look like?'
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'Shall I tell you?' asked Dulcie, her eyes
sparkling with mischief.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, like the Athenian weaver, Bottom,
with his ass's head, at the feet of Titania.
"Dost like the picture?"'
</p>

<p>
Shafto eyed her spitefully, all the more so
that Dulcie laughed merrily, showing all her
pearly teeth at her reply.
</p>

<p>
'Oho, this comes of rambling in quarries,'
said he, bluntly and coarsely; 'doing the
Huguenot business, the <i>pose</i> of Millais'
picture.  Bosh!  What can you and he mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Millais and I?'
</p>

<p>
'No; you and Florian!'
</p>

<p>
'Mean!' exclaimed Dulcie, her sweet face
growing very pale in spite of herself at the
bluntness of Shafto, and the unmistakable
anger of his tone and bearing.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;with your tomfoolery.'
</p>

<p>
'How?&mdash;why?'
</p>

<p>
'Penniless as you are&mdash;he at least.'
</p>

<p>
'Good evening, Shafto; you are very unpleasant,
to say the least of it,' said Dulcie, as
she gathered up her wools and sailed into the
house, while his eyes followed her with a
menacing and very ugly expression indeed.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
THE SECRET PACKET.
</h3>

<p>
The broken health brought by Lennard from
the miasmatic Terai of Nepaul was rapidly
becoming more broken than ever, and,
though not yet fifty, he was a premature old
man, and it seemed as if the first part of
Florian's presentiment or prevision of coming
sorrow would soon be fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
His steps became very feeble, and he could
only get about, in the autumn sunshine, with
the aid of a stick and Florian's arm; and
the latter watched him with grief and pain,
tottering like the aged, panting and leaning
heavily on his cane, as ever and anon he
insisted on being led up a steep slope from
which he could clearly see the old church of
Revelstoke on its wave-beaten promontory,
overlooked by sad and solitary hills, and his
hollow eyes glistened as he gazed on it, with
a kind of yearning expression, as if he longed
to be at peace, and by the side of her he had
laid there, it seemed long years ago&mdash;a lifetime ago.
</p>

<p>
Poor Lennard was certainly near his tomb,
and all who looked upon him thought so; yet
his calm eye, ever looking upward, betrayed
no fear.
</p>

<p>
One day when Florian was absent&mdash;no
doubt sketching, boating with Dulcie on the
Yealm, or idling with her on the moors&mdash;Lennard
besought Shafto to stay beside him
as he sat feeble and languid in his easy chair,
sinking with the wasting and internal fever,
with which the country practitioners were
totally incapable of grappling; and on this
day, for the first time, he began to speak
to him of Scotland and the home he once
had there; and he was listened to with
the keenest interest by Shafto, who had
ever&mdash;even as a child&mdash;been cunning, selfish, and
avaricious, yet wonderfully clever and
complaisant in his uncle's prejudiced eyes, as he
remembered only Flora's dead and devoted
sister.
</p>

<p>
'I have been thinking over old times and
other days, Shafto,' said he, with his
attenuated hands crossed on the head of his
bamboo cane; 'and, all things considered, it
seems an occupation I had better avoid did
the memory concern myself alone: but I
must think of others and their interests&mdash;of
Florian and of you&mdash;so I can't help it, boy,
in my present state of health, or rather
want of health,' he added, as a violent fit of
spasmodic coughing came upon him.
</p>

<p>
After a pause he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
'You, Shafto, are a couple of years older
than Florian, and are, in many ways, several
years older in thought and experience by the
short training you have received in Carlyon's
office.'
</p>

<p>
The Major paused again, leaving Shafto
full of wonder and curiosity as to what this
preamble was leading up to.
</p>

<p>
The former had begun to see things more
clearly and temperately with regard to the
sudden death of Cosmo, and to feel that,
though he had renounced all family ties,
name, and wealth, so far as concerned himself,
to die, with the secret of all untold, would
be to inflict a cruel wrong on Florian.  At
one time Lennard thought of putting his
papers and the whole matter in the hands of
Mr. Lewellen Carlyon, and it was a pity he
did not do so instead of choosing to entrust
them to his long-headed nephew.
</p>

<p>
'Hand here my desk, and unlock it for
me&mdash;my hands are so tremulous,' said he.
</p>

<p>
When this was done he selected a packet
from a private drawer, and briefly and rapidly
told the story of his life, his proper name,
and rank to Shafto, who listened with
open-eyed amazement.
</p>

<p>
When the latter had thoroughly digested the
whole information, he said, after a long pause:
</p>

<p>
'This must be told to Florian!'
</p>

<p>
And with Florian came the thought of
Dulcie, and how this sudden accession of her
lover to fortune and position would affect her.
</p>

<p>
'Nay, Shafto&mdash;not yet&mdash;not till I am gone&mdash;a
short time now.  I can trust you, with
your sharpness and legal acumen, with the
handling of this matter entirely.  When I
am gone, and laid beside your aunt Flora,
by the wall of the old church yonder,' he
continued with a very broken voice&mdash;one
almost a childish treble, 'you will seek the
person to whom this packet is addressed,
Kenneth Kippilaw, a Writer to the Signet in
Edinburgh&mdash;he is alive still; place these in
his hands, and he will do all that is required;
but treasure them, Shafto&mdash;be careful of them
as you would of your soul's salvation&mdash;for
my sake, and more than all for the sake of
Florian!  Now, my good lad, give me the
composing draught&mdash;I feel sleepy and so
weary with all this talking, and the thoughts
that have come unbidden&mdash;unbidden, sad,
bitter, and angry thoughts&mdash;to memory.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto locked the desk, put it aside, and,
giving his uncle the draught, stole softly away
to his own room with the papers, to con them
over and to&mdash;think!
</p>

<p>
He had not sat at a desk for three years in
Lawyer Carlyon's office without having his
wits sharpened.  He paused as he put the
documents away.
</p>

<p>
'Stop&mdash;stop&mdash;let me think, let me
consider!' he exclaimed to himself, and he
certainly did consider to some purpose.  He
was cold and calculating; he was never
unusually agitated or flustered, but he became
both with the thoughts that occurred to him
now.
</p>

<p>
Among the papers and letters entrusted to
him were the certificates of the marriage of
Lennard and Flora, and another which ran
thus:
</p>

<p>
'Certificate of entry of birth, under section
37 of 17 and 18 Vict., cap. 80.'  It authenticated
the birth of their child Florian at
Revelstoke, with the date thereof to a minute.
</p>

<p>
These documents were enclosed in a letter
written in a tremulous and uncertain hand by
Lennard Melfort to Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw,
part of which was in these terms:
</p>

<p>
The child was baptized by a neighbouring
clergyman&mdash;the Rev. Paul Pentreath&mdash;who
has faithfully kept the promise of secrecy he
gave me, and, dying as I now feel myself to
be, I pray earnestly that my father and
mother will be kind to my orphan son.  Let
them not&mdash;as they one day hope for mercy at
that dread throne before which I am soon to
appear&mdash;visit upon his innocent head my
supposed and most heavily punished offence.
Let him succeed in poor Cosmo's place to
that which is his due; let him succeed to all
I renounced in anger&mdash;an anger that has
passed away, for now, my dear old friend, I
am aged beyond my years, and my hair is
now white as snow through ill-health
contracted in India, where, to procure money
necessary for my poor Flora, I volunteered
on desperate service, and in seasons destructive
to existence.  In your hands I leave the
matter with perfect hope and confidence.  The
bearer will tell you all more that may be
necessary.'
</p>

<p>
After having read, reread, and made himself
thoroughly master of the contents of this
to him certainly most astounding packet, he
requested the Major to re-address it in his own
tremulous and all but illegible handwriting,
and seal it up with his long-disused signet
ring, which bore the arms of Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
Prior to having all this done, Shafto had
operated on one of the documents most
dexterously and destructively with his pen-knife!
</p>

<p>
'A peerage! a peerage!&mdash;rank, wealth,
money, mine&mdash;all mine!' he muttered under
his breath, as he stored the packet away in a
sure and secret place, and while whistling
softly to himself, a way he had when brooding
(as he often did) over mischief, he recalled
the lines of Robert Herrick:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Our life is like a narrow raft,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Afloat upon the hungry sea;<br />
  Hereon is but a little space,<br />
  And all men, eager for a place,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do thrust each other in the sea.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
'So why should I not thrust him into the
hungry briny?  If life is a raft&mdash;and, by
Jove, I find it so!&mdash;why should one not grasp
at all one can, and make the best of life for
one's self, by making the worst of it for other
folks?  Does such a chance of winning rank
and wealth come often to any one's hands?
No! and I should be the biggest of fools&mdash;the
most enormous of idiots&mdash;not to avail
myself to the fullest extent.  I see my little
game clearly, but must play warily.  "Eat,
drink, and be merry," says Isaiah, "for
to-morrow we die."  They say the devil can
quote Scripture, and so can Shafto Gyle.
But I don't mean to die to-morrow, but to
have a jolly good spell for many a year to
come!'
</p>

<p>
And in the wild exuberance of his spirits
he tossed his hat again and again to the
ceiling.
</p>

<p>
From that day forward the health of
Lennard Melfort seemed to decline more
rapidly, and erelong he was compelled by
the chill winds of the season to remain in
bed, quite unable to take his place at table or
move about, save when wheeled in a chair to
the window, where he loved to watch the
setting sun.
</p>

<p>
Then came one evening when, for the last
time, he begged to be propped up there in
his pillowed chair.  The sun was setting over
Revelstoke Church, and throwing its
picturesque outline strongly forward, in a dark
indigo tint, against the golden and crimson
flush of the west, and all the waves around
the promontory were glittering in light.
</p>

<p>
But Lennard saw nothing of all this,
though he felt the feeble warmth of the
wintry sun as he stretched his thin, worn
hands towards it; his eyesight was gone, and
would never come again!  There was something
very pathetic in the withered face and
sightless eyes, and the drooping white
moustache that had once been a rich dark-brown,
and waxed <i>à l'Empereur</i>.
</p>

<p>
His dream of life was over, and his last
mutterings were a prayer for Florian, on
whose breast his head lay as he breathed his
last.
</p>

<p>
The two lads looked at each other in that
supreme moment&mdash;but with very different
thoughts in their hearts.  Florian felt only
desolation, blank and utter, and even Shafto,
in the awful presence of Death, felt alone in
the world.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap07"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
A FAREWELL.
</h3>

<p>
As he lay dead, that old-looking, wasted, and
attenuated man, whose hair was like the
thistledown, none would have recognised in
him the dark-haired, bronzed, and joyous
young subaltern who only twenty-four years
before had led his company at the storming
of the Redan, who had planted the scaling-ladder
against the scarp, and shouted in a
voice heard even amid the roar of the adverse
musketry:
</p>

<p>
'Come on, men! ladders to the front,
eight men per ladder; up and at them, lads,
with the bayonet,' and fought his way into
an embrasure, while round-shot tore up the
earth beneath his feet, and men were swept
away in sections of twenty; or the hardy
soldier who faced fever and foes alike in the
Terai of Nepaul.
</p>

<p>
How still and peaceful he lay now as the
coffin-lid was closed over him.
</p>

<p>
Snow-flakes, light and feathery, fell on the
hard ground, and the waves seemed to leap
and sob heavily round the old church of
Revelstoke, when Lennard Melfort was laid
beside the now old and flattened grave
of Flora, and keen and sharp the frosty wind
lifted the silver hair of the Rev. Paul
Pentreath, whistled among the ivy or on the
buttresses, and fluttered the black ribbon of
the pall held by Florian, who felt as one in a
dreadful dream&mdash;amid a dread and unreal
phantasmagoria; and the same wind seemed
to twitch angrily the pall-ribbon from the
hand of Shafto, nor could he by any effort
recover it, as more than one present, with
their Devonian superstition, remarked, and
remembered when other things came to pass.
</p>

<p>
At last all was over; the mourners departed,
and Lennard Melfort was left alone&mdash;alone
with the dead of yesterday and of ages;
and Florian, while Dulcie was by his side and
pressed his hand, strove to commit to memory
the curate's words from the Book of Revelation,
'There shall be no more death, neither
sorrow, nor sighing; for God shall wipe
away all tears from their eyes.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto now let little time pass before he
proceeded to inform Florian of what he
called their 'relative position,' and of their
journey into Scotland to search out Mr. Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that in life we have
sometimes moments so full of emotion that they
seem to mark a turn in it we can never reach
again; and this sharp turn, young and startled
Florian seemed to pass, when he learned that
since infancy he had been misled, and that
the man, so tender and so loving, whom
he had deemed his father was but his uncle!
</p>

<p>
How came it all to pass now?  Yet the
old Major had ever been so kind and affectionate
to him&mdash;to both, in fact, equally so,
treating them as his sons&mdash;that he felt only a
stunning surprise, a crushing grief and bitter
mortification, but not a vestige of anger; his
love for the dead was too keen and deep for
that.
</p>

<p>
The packet, sealed and addressed to
Mr. Kippilaw, though its contents were as yet
unknown to him, seemed to corroborate the
strange intelligence of Shafto; but the
question naturally occurred to Florian, 'For what
end or purpose had this lifelong mystery
and change in their positions been brought
about?'
</p>

<p>
He asked this of Shafto again and again.
</p>

<p>
'It seems we have been very curiously
deluded,' said that personage, not daring to
look the sorrowful Florian straight in the
face, and pretended to be intent on stuffing
his pipe.
</p>

<p>
'Deluded&mdash;how?'
</p>

<p>
'How often am I to tell you,' exclaimed
Shafto, with petulance and assumed irritation,
'that the contents of this packet prove that <i>I</i>
am the only son of Major Melfort (not
MacIan at all), and that you&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?'
</p>

<p>
'Are Florian Gyle, the nephew&mdash;adopted
as a son.  Mr. Kippilaw will tell you all
about it.'
</p>

<p>
'And you, Shafto?' queried Florian,
scarcely knowing, in his bewilderment, what
he said.
</p>

<p>
'Mean to go in for my proper position&mdash;my
title, and all that sort of thing, don't you
see?'
</p>

<p>
'And act&mdash;how!'
</p>

<p>
'Not the proverbial beggar on horseback,
I hope.  I'll do something handsome for you,
of course.'
</p>

<p>
'I want nothing done for me while I have
two hands, Shafto.'
</p>

<p>
'As you please,' replied the latter, puffing
vigorously at his pipe.  'I have had enough
of hopeless drudgery for a quarterly pittance
in the dingy office of old Carlyon,' said he,
after a long pause; 'and, by all the devils,
I'll have no more of it now that I am going
to be rich.'
</p>

<p>
Indeed, from the day of Lennard Melfort
entrusting him with the packet, Shafto had
done little else at the office but study the
laws of succession in Scotland and England.
</p>

<p>
'How much you love money, Shafto!'
said Florian, eying him wistfully.
</p>

<p>
'Do I?  Well, I suppose that comes from
having had so precious little of it in my
time.  I am a poor devil just now, but,' thought
he exultantly, 'this "plant" achieved successfully,
how many matrons with daughters
unmarried will all be anxious to be mother to
me!  And Dulcie Carlyon I might have for
asking; but I'll fly at higher game now, by
Jove!'
</p>

<p>
As further credentials, Shafto now
possessed himself of Major Melfort's sword,
commissions, and medals, while Florian
looked in blank dismay and growing
mortification&mdash;puzzled by the new position in which
he found himself, of being no longer his father's
son&mdash;a source of unfathomable mystery.
</p>

<p>
Shafto was in great haste to be gone, to
leave Revelstoke and its vicinity behind him.
It was too late for regrets or repentance now.
Not that he felt either, we suppose; and
what he had done he would do again if there
was no chance of being found out.  In the
growing exuberance of his spirits, he could
not help, a day or two after, taunting Florian
about Dulcie till they were on the verge of a
quarrel, and wound up by saying, with a
scornful laugh:
</p>

<p>
'You can't marry her&mdash;a fellow without a
shilling in the world; and I wouldn't now,
if she would have me, which I don't doubt.'
</p>

<p>
Poor Dulcie!  She heard with undisguised
grief and astonishment of these events, and
of the approaching departure of the cousins.
</p>

<p>
The cottage home was being broken up;
the dear old Major was in his grave; and
Florian, the playmate of her infancy, the
lover of her girlhood, was going away&mdash;she
scarcely knew to where.  They might be
permitted to correspond by letter, but when,
thought Dulcie&mdash;oh, when should they meet
again?
</p>

<p>
The sun was shedding its light and warmth
around her as usual, on woodland and hill, on
wave and rock; but both seemed to fade out,
the perfume to pass from the early spring
flowers, the glory from land and sea, and a
dim mist of passionate tears clouded the
sweet and tender blue eyes of the affectionate
girl.
</p>

<p>
He would return, he said, as he strove to
console her; but how and when, and to what
end? thought both so despairingly.  Their
future seemed such a vague, a blank one!
</p>

<p>
'I am penniless, Dulcie&mdash;a beggar on the
face of the earth&mdash;twice beggared now, I
think!' exclaimed Florian, in sorrowful bitterness.
</p>

<p>
'Don't speak thus,' said she imploringly,
with piteous lips that were tremulous as his
own, and her eyes drowned in tears.
</p>

<p>
They had left the road now, and wandered
among the trees in a thicket, and seated
themselves on a fallen trunk, a seat and place
endeared to them and familiar enough in past time.
</p>

<p>
He gazed into her eyes of deep pansy-blue,
as if his own were striving to take away a
memory of her face&mdash;a memory that would
last for eternity.
</p>

<p>
'And you really go to-night?' she asked,
in piteous and broken accents.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;with Shafto.  I am in a fever,
darling, to seek out a position for myself.
Surely Shafto may assist me in that&mdash;though
I shrink from asking him.'
</p>

<p>
'Your own cousin?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;but sometimes he looks like a
supplanter now, and his bearing has been so
unpleasant to me, especially of late,' said
Florian.  'But you will wait for me, Dulcie,
and not be persuaded to marry anyone else?'
he added imploringly, as he clasped each of
her hands in his.
</p>

<p>
'I shall wait for you, Florian, if it should
be for twenty years!' exclaimed the girl, in a
low and emphatic voice, scarcely considering
the magnitude and peril of such a promise.
</p>

<p>
'Thank you, darling Dulcie!' said he
bending down and kissing her lips with
ardour, and, though on the eve of parting,
they felt almost happy in the confidence of
the blissful present.
</p>

<p>
'How often shall I recall this last meeting
by the fallen tree, when you are far, far
away from Revelstoke and&mdash;me,' said Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
'You will often come here to be reminded
of me?'
</p>

<p>
'Do you think, Florian, I will require to
be reminded of you?' asked the girl, with a
little tone of pain in her sweet voice, as she
kissed the silver locket containing his likeness,
and all the sweet iteration of lover-talk,
promises, and pledges went on for a time,
and new hopes began to render this last
interview more bearable to the young pair who
were on the eve of separation, without any
very distinct arrangement about correspondence
in the interval of it.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting now redly, and amid
dun winter clouds, beaming on each chimney-head,
on Revelstoke Church, and the leafless
tree-tops his farewell radiance.
</p>

<p>
Florian took a long, long kiss from Dulcie,
and with the emotion of a wrench in his
heart, was gone, and she was alone.
</p>

<p>
A photo and a lock of red-golden hair were
all that remained to him of her&mdash;both to be
looked upon again and again, till his eyes
ached, but never grew weary.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie's were very red with weeping, and
the memory of that parting kiss was still
hovering on her quivering lips when, in
a lonely lane not far from her home, she
found herself suddenly face to face with
Shafto.
</p>

<p>
She had known him from his boyhood,
ever since he came an orphan to Lennard
Melfort's cottage; and although she always
distrusted and never liked him, his face was
a familiar one she might never see more; thus
she resolved to part with him as with the best
of friends, and to remember that he was the
only kinsman of Florian, whose companion
and fellow-traveller he was to be on a journey
the end of which she scarcely understood.
So, frankly and sweetly, with a sad smile in
her eyes, she proffered her pretty hand,
which Shafto grasped and retained promptly
enough.
</p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
THE SILVER LOCKET.
</h3>

<p>
Shafto had just been with her father.  How
contemptuously he had eyed the corner and
the high old stool on which he had sat in the
latter's legal establishment, and all its
surroundings; the fly-blown county maps of
Devon and Cornwall; advertisements of
sales&mdash;property, mangold wurzel, oats and hay,
Thorley's food for cattle, and so forth; the
tin boxes of most legal aspect; dockets of
papers in red tape; the well-thumbed ledgers;
day and letter books, and all the paraphernalia
of a country solicitor's office.
</p>

<p>
Ugh!  How well he knew and loathed
them all.  Now it was all over and done with.
</p>

<p>
The three poor lads in the office, whose
cheap cigars and beer he had often shared at
the Ashburton Arms, he barely condescended
to notice, while they regarded him with
something akin to awe, as he gave Lawyer Carlyon
his final 'instructions' concerning the disposal
of the lease of the Major's pretty cottage,
and of all the goods and chattels that were
therein.
</p>

<p>
Had Florian been present he would have
felt only shame and abasement at the tone
and manner Shafto adopted on this occasion;
but worthy Lawyer Carlyon, who did not
believe a bit in the rumoured accession of
Shafto to family rank and wealth, laughed
softly to himself, and thought his 'pride would
have a sore fall one of these fine days.'
</p>

<p>
And even now, when face to face with
Dulcie, his general bearing, his coolness and
insouciance, rendered her, amid all her grief,
indignant and defiant ultimately.
</p>

<p>
How piquant, compact, and perfect the girl
looked, from the smart scarlet feather in her
little hat to her tiny Balmoral boots.  Her
veil was tightly tied across her face, showing
only the tip of her nose, her ripe red lips, and
pretty white chin&mdash;its point, like her cheeks,
reddened somewhat by the winter breeze from
the Channel.  Her gloved hands were in her
small muff, and the collar of her sealskin
jacket was encircled by the necklet at which
her silver locket hung&mdash;the locket Shafto
had seen her kiss when Florian had bestowed
it on her, while he looked close by, with his
heart full of envy, jealousy, and hatred, and
now it was the first thing that attracted his eye.
</p>

<p>
'And you actually leave us to-night, Shafto?'
she said softly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, Dulcie, by the train for Worcester
and the north.  My estates, you know, are
in Scotland.'
</p>

<p>
'These changes are all strange and most
startling,' said she, with a sob in her slender
throat.
</p>

<p>
'We live in whirligig times, Dulcie; but I
suppose it is the result of progress,' he added
sententiously.  'I wonder how our grandfathers
and grandmothers contrived to mope
over and yawn out their dull and emotionless
existence till they reached threescore and ten years.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall never see that age, Shafto.'
</p>

<p>
'Who knows; though life, however sweet
now, won't be worth living for then, I fancy.'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie sighed, and he regarded her in
admiring silence, for he had a high appreciation
of her bright and delicate beauty, and
loved her&mdash;if we may degrade the phrase&mdash;in
his own selfish and peculiar way, though
now resolved&mdash;as he had often thought vainly&mdash;to
'fly at higher game;' and so, full of
ideas, hopes, and ambitions of his own, if he
had ceased to think of Dulcie, he had, at
least, ceased for a space to trouble her.
</p>

<p>
'Florian will be writing to you, of course?'
said he, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Alas! no, we have made no arrangement;
and then, you know, papa&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Wouldn't approve, of course.  My farewell
advice to you, Dulcie, is&mdash;Don't put off
your time thinking of Florian&mdash;his ship will
never come home.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor yours either, perhaps,' said Dulcie, angrily.
</p>

<p>
'You think so&mdash;but you are wrong.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah!  I know these waited for ships rarely do.'
</p>

<p>
'I have read somewhere that ships of the
kind rarely do come home in this prosaic and
disappointing world; that some get wrecked
almost within sight of land; others go down
without the flapping of a sail, and sometimes
after long and firm battling with adverse
winds and tides; but <i>my ship</i> is a sure craft,
Dulcie,' he added, as he thought of the packet
in his possession&mdash;that precious packet on
which all his hopes rested and his daring
ambition was founded.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie looked at him wistfully and distrustfully,
and thought&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Why is he so sure?  But his ideas were
always selfish and evil.  Tide what may,'
she added aloud, 'I shall wait twenty years
and more for Florian.'
</p>

<p>
'The more fool you, then!  And so die an
old maid?'
</p>

<p>
'I am, perhaps, cut out for an old maid.'
</p>

<p>
'And if he never can marry you&mdash;or
marries some one else when he can?' asked
Shafto viciously.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, then I'll take to æstheticism, or
women's rights, and all that sort of thing,'
said the poor girl, with a ghastly and defiant
attempt at a jest, which ended in tears, while
Shafto eyed her angrily.
</p>

<p>
'How fond you are of that silver locket&mdash;you
never wear any other!'
</p>

<p>
'I have so few ornaments, Shafto.'
</p>

<p>
'And none you prize so much?'
</p>

<p>
'None!' said Dulcie, with a sweet, sad smile.
</p>

<p>
'Is that the reason you wear it with all
kinds of dresses?  What is in it&mdash;anything?'
</p>

<p>
'That is my secret,' replied Dulcie, putting
her right hand on it and instinctively drawing
back a pace, for there was a menacing expression
in the cold grey eyes of Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'Allow me to open it,' said he, taking her
hand in his.
</p>

<p>
'No.'
</p>

<p>
'You shall!'
</p>

<p>
'Never!' exclaimed Dulcie, her eyes
sparkling now as his grasp upon her hand
tightened.
</p>

<p>
An imprecation escaped Shafto, and with
his eyes aflame and his cheeks pale with
jealousy and rage he tore her hand aside and
wrenched by brutal force the locket from her,
breaking the silver necklet as he did so.
</p>

<p>
'Coward!' exclaimed Dulcie; 'coward and
thief&mdash;how dare you?  Surrender that locket
instantly!'
</p>

<p>
'Not if I know it,' said he, mockingly,
holding the prized trinket before her at arm's
length.
</p>

<p>
'But for Florian's sake, I would at once
apply to the police.'
</p>

<p>
'A vulgar resort&mdash;no, my pretty Dulcie,
you wouldn't.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'Not for Florian's sake?'
</p>

<p>
'Whose, then?'
</p>

<p>
'Your own, for you wouldn't like to have
your old pump of a father down on you; and
so you dare not make a row about it, my
pretty little fury.'
</p>

<p>
'Shafto, I entreat you, give me back that
photo,' said Dulcie, her tears welling forth.
</p>

<p>
'No; I won't.'
</p>

<p>
'Of what interest or use can it be to you?'
</p>

<p>
'More than you imagine,' said Shafto, to
whom a villainous idea just then occurred.
</p>

<p>
'I entreat you,' said Dulcie, letting her
muff drop and clasping her slim little hands.
</p>

<p>
'Entreat away!  I feel deucedly inclined
to put my heel upon it&mdash;but I won't.'
</p>

<p>
'This robbery is cruel and infamous!'
exclaimed Dulcie, trembling with grief and just
indignation; but Shafto only laughed in
anger and bitterness&mdash;and a very hyena-like
laugh it was, and as some one was coming
down the secluded lane, he turned away and
left her in the twilight.
</p>

<p>
He felt himself safe from opprobrium and
punishment, as he knew well she was loth to
make any complaint to her father on the
subject; and just then she knew not how to
communicate with Florian, as the darkness
was falling fast, and the hour of his departure
was close at hand.  She thought it not
improbable that Shafto would relent and return
the locket to her; but the night was far
advanced ere that hope was dissipated, and she
attained some outward appearance of
composure, though her father's sharp and
affectionate eyes detected that she had been
suffering.
</p>

<p>
He had heard from her some confused
and rambling story about the family secret,
the packet, and the peerage, a story of which
he could make nothing, though Shafto's
bearing to himself that evening seemed to
confirm the idea that 'there was something in
it.'  Anyway, Mr. Carlyon was not indisposed
to turn the event to account in one sense.
</p>

<p>
'Likely&mdash;likely enough, Dulcie lass,' said
he; 'and so you'll hear no more of these
two lads, if they are likely to become great
folks, and belong to what is called the upper
ten; they'll never think again of a poor
village belle like you, though there is not a
prettier face in all Devonshire than my
Dulcie's from Lyme Regis to Cawsand Bay.'
</p>

<p>
He meant this kindly, and spoke with a
purpose; and his words and the warning
they conveyed sank bitterly into the tender
heart of poor Dulcie.
</p>

<p>
By this time the cousins were sweeping
through the darkness in the express train by
Exeter, Taunton, and so forth; both were
very silent, and each was full of his own
thoughts, and what these were the reader
may very well imagine.
</p>

<p>
Heedless of the covert and sneering smiles
of Shafto, Florian, from time to time, drew
forth the photo of Dulcie, and her shining
lock of red-golden hair, his sole links between
the past and the present; and already he felt
as if a score of years had lapsed since they
sat side by side upon the fallen tree.
</p>

<p>
Then, that he might give his whole
thoughts to Dulcie, he affected to sleep; but
Shafto did not sleep for hours.  He sat
quietly enough with his face in shadow, his
travelling-cap of tweed-check pulled well
down over his watchful and shifty grey-green
eyes, the lamp overhead giving a miserable
glimmer suited to the concealment of expression
and thought; and as the swift train sped
northward, the cousins addressed not a word
to each other concerning those they had left
behind, what was before them, or anything else.
</p>

<p>
After a time, Shafto really slept&mdash;slept the
slumber which is supposed to be the reward
of the just and conscientious, but which is
much more often enjoyed by those who have
no conscience at all.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie contrived to despatch a letter to
Florian detailing the outrage to which she
had been subjected by Shafto; but time
passed on, and, for a reason we shall give in
its place, the letter never reached him.
</p>

<p>
Again and again she recalled and rehearsed
her farewell with Florian, and thought
regretfully of his passionate pride, and desperate
poverty too probably, if he quarrelled with
Shafto; and she still seemed to see his
beautiful dark eyes, dim with unshed tears, while
her own welled freely and bitterly.
</p>

<p>
When could they meet again, if ever, and
where and how?  Her heart and brain
ached with these questions.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie did not bemoan her fate, though
her cheek paled a little, and she felt&mdash;even
at her early years&mdash;as if life seemed over
and done with, and in her passionate love for
the absent, that existence alone was left to
her, and so forth.
</p>

<p>
And as she was her father's housekeeper
now, kept the keys and paid all the servants,
paid all accounts and made the preserves, he
was in no way sorry that the young men were
gone; that the 'aimless philandering,' as he
deemed it, had come to an end; and that
much would be attended to in his cosy little
household which he suspected&mdash;but unjustly&mdash;had
been neglected hitherto.
</p>

<p>
To Dulcie, the whole locality of her native
place, the breezy moors, the solitary hills, the
mysterious Druid pillars and logan stones,
the rocky shore, and the pretty estuary of the
Yealm, where they had been wont to boat
and fish for pilchards in summer and autumn,
were all full of the haunting presence of the
absent&mdash;the poor but proud and handsome
lad who from boyhood, yea from infancy, had
loved her, and who now seemed to have
slipped out of her existence.
</p>

<p>
Spring melted into summer; golden sunshine
flooded hill and dale, and lit up the
waters of the Erm, the Yealm, and the
far-stretching Channel, tinting with wondrous
gleams and hues the waves that rolled upon
the shore, or boiled about the Mewstorre
Rock, and the sea-beaten promontory of
Revelstoke; but to Dulcie the glory was
gone from land and water: she heard no
more, by letter or otherwise, of the love of
her youth; he seemed to have dropped
utterly out of her sphere; and though
mechanically she gathered the fragrant leaves of
the bursting June roses&mdash;the Marshal Neil
and Gloire de Dijon&mdash;and treasured them
carefully in rare old china jars and vases, a
task in which she had often been assisted by
Florian, she felt and thought&mdash;'Ichabod!
Ichabod! the glory has departed!'
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
MR. KIPPILAW, W.S.
</h3>

<p>
Shafto found himself a little nervous when
he and Florian were actually in Edinburgh, a
city in its beauty, boldness and grandeur of
rock and mountain, fortress, terrace, and
temple, so foreign-looking to English eyes,
and so utterly unlike everything they had
ever seen or conceived before.
</p>

<p>
Florian's thoughts were peculiarly his own.
His father's death&mdash;though called an uncle
now, but Florian always felt for and thought
of him as a parent&mdash;the loss of Dulcie, their
abrupt departure from Devonshire, and rough
uprootal of all early associations, had made a
kind of hiatus in the young fellow's life, and
it was only now when he found himself amid
the strange streets and picturesque splendour
of Edinburgh that he began&mdash;like one
recovering consciousness after a long
illness&mdash;to gather up again the ravelled threads of
thought, but with curious want of concern and
energy; while Shafto felt that he personally
had both, and that now he required to have
all his wits about him.
</p>

<p>
Florian stood for a time that night at the
door of their hotel in Princes Street looking
at the wonderful lights of the Old Town
sparkling in mid air, and some that were in
the Castle must, he thought, be stars, they
were so high above the earth.  Scores of
cabs and carriages went by, eastward and
westward, but no carts or wains or lorries,
such as one sees in London or Glasgow&mdash;vehicles
with bright lamps and well muffled
occupants, gentlemen in evening suits, and
ladies in ball or dinner dresses, and crowds of
pedestrians, under the brilliant gas lights and
long boulevard-like lines of trees&mdash;the
ever-changing human panorama of a great city
street before midnight.
</p>

<p>
How odd, how strange and lonely poor
Florian felt; he seemed to belong to no one,
and, like the Miller o' Dee, nobody cared for
him; and ever and anon his eyes rested on
the mighty castled rock that towers above
streets, monuments, and gardens, with a
wonderous history all its own, 'where
treasured lie the monarchy's last gems,' and
with them the only ancient crown in the
British Isles.  'Brave kings and the fairest
of crowned women have slept and been
cradled in that eyrie,' says an enthusiastic
English writer; 'heroes have fought upon its
slopes; English armies have stormed it;
dukes, earls, and barons have been
immured in its strong dungeons; a sainted
Queen prayed and yielded up her last breath
there eight centuries ago.  It is an imperishable
relic&mdash;a monument that needs no carving
to tell its tale, and it has the nation's worship;
and the different church sects cling round its
base as if they would fight again for the
guardianship of a venerable mother.....
And if Scotland has no longer a king and
Parliament all to herself, her imperial crown
is at least safely kept up there amid strong
iron stanchions, as a sacred memorial of her
inextinguishable independence, and, if need
were, for future use.'
</p>

<p>
Florian was a reader and a thinker, and he
felt a keen interest in all that now surrounded
him; but Shafto lurked in a corner of the
smoke-room, turning in his mind the task of
the morrow, and unwisely seeking to fortify
himself by imbibing more brandy and soda
than Florian had ever seen him take before.
</p>

<p>
After a sound night's rest and a substantial
Scottish breakfast had fitted Shafto, as he
thought, for facing anything, a cab deposited
him and Florian (who was now beginning to
marvel why he had travelled so far in a
matter that concerned him not, in reality)
at the residence of Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw,
W.S., in Charlotte Square&mdash;a noble specimen
of Adams Street architecture, having four
stately symmetrical corresponding façades,
overlooked by the dome of St. George's
Church.
</p>

<p>
'Lawyers evidently thrive in Scotland,'
said Shafto, as he looked at the mansion of
Mr. Kippilaw, and mentally recalled the
modest establishment of Lawyer Carlyon;
'but foxes will flourish as long as there are
geese to be plucked.'
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw was at home&mdash;indeed he was
just finishing breakfast, before going to the
Parliament House&mdash;as they were informed by
the liveried valet, who led them through a
pillared and marble-floored vestibule, and
ushered them into what seemed a library, as
the walls from floor to ceiling were lined
with handsome books; but every professional
man's private office has generally this
aspect in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
In a few minutes Mr. Kippilaw appeared
with a puzzled and perplexed expression in
his face, as he alternatively looked at his two
visitors, and at Shafto's card in his hand.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw was now in his sixtieth year;
his long since grizzled hair had now become
white, and had shrunk to two patches far
apart, one over each ear, and brushed stiffly
up.  His eyebrows were also white, shaggy,
and under them his keen eyes peered
sharply through the rims of a gold pince-nez
balanced on the bridge of his long aquiline
nose.
</p>

<p>
Shafto felt just then a strange and unpleasant
dryness about his tongue and lips.
</p>

<p>
'<i>Mr. Shafto Melfort?</i>' said Mr. Kippilaw
inquiringly, and referring to the card again.  'I
was not aware that there was a Mr. Shafto
Melfort&mdash;any relation of Lord Fettercairn?'
</p>

<p>
'His grandson,' said Shafto unblushingly.
</p>

<p>
'This gentleman with the dark eyes?'
asked Mr. Kippilaw, turning to the silent
Florian.
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;myself,' said Shafto sharply and
firmly.
</p>

<p>
'You are most unlike the family, who have
always been remarkable for regularity of
features.  Then you are the son&mdash;of&mdash;of&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'The late Major Lennard Melfort who died
a few weeks ago&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Good Heavens, where?'
</p>

<p>
'On the west coast of Devonshire, near
Revelstoke, where he had long resided under
the assumed name of MacIan.'
</p>

<p>
'That of his wife?'
</p>

<p>
'Precisely so&mdash;my mother.'
</p>

<p>
'And this young gentleman, whose face
and features seem curiously familiar to me,
though I never saw him before, he is your
brother of course.'
</p>

<p>
'No, my cousin, the son of my aunt Mrs. Gyle.
I am an only son, but the Major ever
treated us as if he had been the father of both,
so great and good was his kindness of heart.'
</p>

<p>
'Be seated, please,' said the lawyer in a
breathless voice, as he seated himself in an
ample leathern elbow chair at his writing-table,
which was covered with documents and
letters all arranged by his junior clerk in the
most orderly manner.
</p>

<p>
'This is very sudden and most unexpected
intelligence,' said he, carefully wiping his
glasses, and subjecting Shafto's visage to a
closer scrutiny again.  'Have you known all
these years past the real name and position of
your father, and that he left Kincardineshire
more than twenty years ago after a very grave
quarrel with his parents at Craigengowan?'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;I only learned who he was, and who
we really were, when he was almost on his
deathbed.  He confided it to me alone, as his
only son, and because I had been bred to the
law; and on that melancholy occasion he
entrusted me with this important packet
addressed to <i>you</i>.'
</p>

<p>
With an expression of the deepest interest
pervading his well-lined face, Mr. Kippilaw
took the packet and carefully examined the
seal and the superscription, penned in a
shaky handwriting, with both of which he was
familiar enough, though he had seen neither
for fully twenty years, and finally he
examined the envelope, which looked old and
yellow.
</p>

<p>
'If all be true and correct, these tidings will
make some stir at Craigengowan,' he muttered
as if to himself, and cut round the seal with a
penknife.
</p>

<p>
'You will find ample proofs, sir, of all I
have alleged,' said Shafto, who now felt that
the crisis was at hand.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw, with growing interest and
wonder, drew forth the documents and read
and re-read them slowly and carefully, holding
the papers, but not offensively, between
him and the light to see if the dates and
water-marks tallied.
</p>

<p>
'The slow way this old devil goes on
would exasperate an oyster!' thought Shafto,
whose apparently perfect coolness and
self-possession rather surprised and repelled the
lawyer.
</p>

<p>
There were the certificate of Lennard's
marriage with Flora MacIan, which Mr. Kippilaw
could remember he had seen of old;
the 'certificate of entry of birth of their son,
born at Revelstoke at 6 h. 50 m. on the 28th
October P.M., 18&mdash;,' signed by the Registrar,
and the Major's farewell letter to his old
friend, entrusting his son and his son's
interests to his care.
</p>

<p>
'But, hallo!' exclaimed Mr. Kippilaw, after
he had read for the second time, and saw that
the letter of Lennard Melfort was undoubtedly
authentic, 'how comes it that the whole of
your Christian name is <i>torn out</i> of the birth
certificate, and the surname <i>Melfort</i> alone
remains?'
</p>

<p>
'Torn out!' exclaimed Shafto, apparently
startled in turn.
</p>

<p>
'There is a rough little hole in the
document where the name <i>should be</i>.  Do you
know the date of your birth?' asked
Mr. Kippilaw, partly covering the document with
his hand, unconsciously as it were.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;28th October.'
</p>

<p>
'And the year?'
</p>

<p>
Shafto gave it from memory.
</p>

<p>
'Quite correct&mdash;as given here,' said
Mr. Kippilaw; 'but you look old for the date of
this certificate.'
</p>

<p>
'I always looked older than my years,'
replied Shafto.
</p>

<p>
Florian, who might have claimed the date
as that of his own birth, was&mdash;luckily for
Shafto&mdash;away at a window, gazing intently
on a party of soldiers marching past, with a
piper playing before them.
</p>

<p>
'Another certificate can be got if necessary,'
said Mr. Kippilaw, as he glanced at the
Registrar's signature, a suggestion which
made Shafto's heart quake.  'It must have
come from the Major in this mutilated state,'
he added, re-examining with legal care and
suspicion the address on the envelope and
the seal, which, as we have said, he had cut
round; 'but it is strange that he has made
no mention of it being so in his letter to me.
Poor fellow! he was more of a soldier than a
man of business, however.  Allow me to
congratulate you, Mr. Melfort, on your new
prospects.  Rank and a very fine estate are
before you.'
</p>

<p>
He warmly shook the hand of Shafto, who
began to be more reassured; and saying, 'I
must carefully preserve the documents for the
inspection of Lord Fettercairn,' he locked
them fast in a drawer of his writing-table, and
spreading out his coat-tails before the fire,
while warming his person in the fashion
peculiar to the genuine 'Britisher,' he eyed
Shafto benignantly, and made a few pleasant
remarks on the Fettercairn family, the
fertility and beauty of Craigengowan, the
stables, kennels, the shootings, and so forth,
and the many fine qualities of 'Leonard'&mdash;as
he called him&mdash;and about whom he asked
innumerable questions, all of which Shafto
could answer truly and with a clear conscience
enough, as he was master of all that.
</p>

<p>
The latter was asked 'what he thought
of Edinburgh&mdash;if he had ever been there
before,' and so forth.  Shafto remembered a
little 'Guide Book' into which he had
certainly dipped, so as to be ready for
anything, and spoke so warmly of the picturesque
beauties and historical associations of the
Modern Athens that the worthy lawyer's
heart began to warm to so intelligent a
young man, while of the silent Florian,
staring out into the sun-lit square and its
beautiful garden and statues, he took little
notice, beyond wondering <i>where</i> he had seen
his eyes and features before!

CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
ALONE IN THE WORLD.
</h3>

<p>
'And you were bred to the law, you say,
Mr. Melfort?' remarked the old Writer to the
Signet after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'Yes, in Lawyer Carlyon's office.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good&mdash;very good indeed; that is
well!  We generally think in Scotland that
a little knowledge of the law is useful, as it
teaches the laird to haud his ain; but I
forgot that you are southland bred, and
born too&mdash;the more is the pity&mdash;and can't
understand me.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto did not understand him, but thought
that his time spent in Lawyer Carlyon's
office had not been thrown away now;
experience there had 'put him up to a trick or
two.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall write to Craigengowan by the first
post,' said Mr. Kippilaw after another of
those thoughtful pauses during which he
attentively eyed his visitor.  'Lord and Lady
Fettercairn&mdash;like myself now creeping up the
vale of years&mdash;(Hope they may soon see
the end of it! thought Shafto) will, I have
no doubt, be perfectly satisfied by the sequence
and tenor of the documents you have brought
me that you are their grandson&mdash;the son of
the expatriated Lennard&mdash;and when I hear
from them I shall let you know the result
without delay.  You are putting up at&mdash;what
hotel?'
</p>

<p>
'At the Duke of Rothesay, in Princes Street.'
</p>

<p>
'Ah! very well.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks; I shall be very impatient to hear.'
</p>

<p>
'And your cousin&mdash;he will, of course, go
with you to Craigengowan?'
</p>

<p>
Shafto hesitated, and actually coloured, as
Florian could detect.
</p>

<p>
'What are your intentions or views?'
Mr. Kippilaw asked the latter.
</p>

<p>
'He failed to pass for the army,' said
Shafto bluntly and glibly, 'so I don't know
what he means to do <i>now</i>.  I believe that he
scarcely knows himself.'
</p>

<p>
'Have you no friends on your mother's
side, Mr. Florian?'
</p>

<p>
'None!' said Florian, with a sad inflection
of voice.
</p>

<p>
'Indeed! and what do you mean to do?'
</p>

<p>
'Follow the drum, most probably,' replied
Florian bitterly and a little defiantly, as
Shafto's coldness, amid his own great and
good fortune, roused his pride and galled his
heart, which sank as he thought of Dulcie
Carlyon, sweet, golden-haired English Dulcie,
so far away.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Kippilaw shook his bald head at the
young man's answer.
</p>

<p>
'I have some little influence in many ways,
and if I can assist your future views you may
command me, Mr. Florian,' said he with
fatherly kindness, for he had reared&mdash;yea and
lost&mdash;more than one fine lad of his own.
</p>

<p>
It has been said that one must know mankind
very well before having the courage to
be solely and simply oneself; thus, as Shafto's
knowledge of mankind was somewhat limited,
he felt his eye quail more than once under
the steady gaze of Mr. Kippilaw.
</p>

<p>
'It is a very strange thing,' said the latter,
'that after the death of Mr. Cosmo in Glentilt,
when Lord and Lady Fettercairn were so
anxious to discover and recall his younger
brother as the next and only heir to the title
and estates, we totally failed to trace him.
We applied to the War Office for the
whereabouts of Major Lennard Melfort, but the
authorities there, acting upon a certain
principle, declined to afford any information.
Advertisements, some plainly distinct, others
somewhat enigmatical, were often inserted in
the <i>Scotsman</i> and <i>Times</i>, but without the
least avail.
</p>

<p>
'As for the <i>Scotsman</i>,' said Shafto, 'the Major&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Your father, you mean?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, reddening, 'was no more
likely to see such a provincial print in
Devonshire than the Roman <i>Diritto</i> or the
Prussian <i>Kreuz Zeitung</i>; and the <i>Times</i>, if
he saw it&mdash;which I doubt&mdash;he must have
ignored.  Till the time of his death drew
near, his feelings were bitter, his hostility to
his family great.'
</p>

<p>
'I can well understand that, poor fellow!'
said Mr. Kippilaw, glancing at his watch, as
he added&mdash;'You must excuse me till
to-morrow: I am already overdue at the
Parliament House.'
</p>

<p>
He bowed his visitors out into the sun-lit
square.
</p>

<p>
'You seem to have lost your tongue,
Florian, and to have a disappointed look,'
said Shafto snappishly, as they walked
slowly towards the hotel together.
</p>

<p>
'Disappointed I am in one sense, perhaps,
but I have no reason to repine or complain
save at our change of relative positions, but
certainly not at your unexpected good fortune,
Shafto.  It is only right and just that your
father's only son should inherit all that is
legally and justly his.'
</p>

<p>
Even at these words Shafto never winced
or wavered in plans or purpose.
</p>

<p>
It was apparent, however, to Florian, that
he had for some time past looked restless
and uneasy, that he started and grew pale at
any unusual sound, while a shadow rested on
his not usually very open countenance.
</p>

<p>
Betimes next morning a note came to him
at the Duke of Rothesay Hotel from
Mr. Kippilaw, requesting a visit as early as
possible, and on this errand he departed alone.
</p>

<p>
He found the old lawyer radiant, with a
letter in his hand from Lord Fettercairn (in
answer to his own) expressive of astonishment
and joy at the sudden appearance of
this hitherto unknown grandson, whom he
was full of ardour and anxiety to see.
</p>

<p>
'You will lose no time in starting for
Craigengowan,' said Mr. Kippilaw.  'You
take the train at the Waverley Station and
go <i>viâ</i> Burntisland, Arbroath, and Marykirk&mdash;or
stay, I think we shall proceed together,
taking your papers with us.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks,' said Shafto, feeling somehow
that the presence of Mr. Kippilaw at the
coming interview would take some of the
responsibility off his own shoulders.
</p>

<p>
'Craigengowan, your grandfather says, will
put on its brightest smile to welcome you.'
</p>

<p>
'Very kind of Craigengowan,' said Shafto,
who felt but ill at ease in his new role of
adventurer, and unwisely adopted a
free-and-easy audacity of manner.
</p>

<p>
'A cheque on the Bank of Scotland for
present emergencies,' said Mr. Kippilaw,
opening his cheque-book, 'and in two hours
we shall meet at the station.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks again.  How kind you are, my dear sir.'
</p>

<p>
'I would do much for your father's son,
Mr. Shafto,' said the lawyer, emphatically.
</p>

<p>
'And what about Florian?'
</p>

<p>
'The letter ignores him&mdash;a curious omission.
In their joy, perhaps Lord and Lady Fettercairn
forgot.  But, by the way, here is a letter
for him that came by the London mail.'
</p>

<p>
'A letter for him!' said Shafto, faintly,
while his heart grew sick with apprehension,
he knew not of what.
</p>

<p>
'Mr. Florian's face is strangely familiar to
me,' said Mr. Kippilaw aloud; but to himself,
'Dear me, dear me, where can I have seen
features like his before?  He reminds me
curiously of Lennard Melfort.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto gave a nervous start.
</p>

<p>
The letter was a bulky one, and bore the
Wembury and other post-marks, and to
Shafto's infinite relief was addressed in the
familiar handwriting of Dulcie Carlyon.
</p>

<p>
He chuckled, and a great thought worthy
of himself occurred to him.
</p>

<p>
In the solitude of his own room at the
hotel, he moistened and opened the gummed
envelope, and drew forth four closely written
sheets of paper full of the outpourings of the
girl's passionate heart, of her wrath at the
theft of her locket by Shafto, and mentioning
that she had incidentally got the address of
Mr. Kippilaw from her father, and desiring
him to write to her, and she would watch for
and intercept the postman by the sea-shore.
</p>

<p>
'Bosh,' muttered Shafto, as he tore up and
cast into the fire Dulcie's letter, all save a
postscript, written on a separate scrap of
paper, and which ran thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You have all the love of my heart, Florian;
but, as I feel and fear we may never meet
again, I send you this, which I have worn
next my heart, to keep.'
</p>

<p>
<i>This</i> was a tiny tuft of forget-me-nots.
</p>

<p>
'Three stamps on all this raggabash!'
exclaimed Shafto, whom the girl's terms of
endearment to Florian filled with a tempest
of jealous rage.  He rolled the locket he had
wrenched from Dulcie's neck in soft paper,
and placed it with the postscript in the
envelope, which he carefully closed and
re-gummed, placed near the fire, and the moment
it was perfectly dry he gave it to Florian.
</p>

<p>
If the latter was surprised to see a letter to
himself, addressed in Dulcie's large, clear,
and pretty handwriting, to the care of 'Lawyer
Kippilaw,' as she called him, he was also
struck dumb when he found in the envelope
the locket, the likeness, and the apparently
curt farewell contained in one brief sentence!
</p>

<p>
For a time he stood like one petrified.
Could it all be real?  Alas! there was no
doubting the postal marks and stamps upon
this most fatal cover; and while he was
examining it and passing his hand wildly more
than once across his eyes and forehead, Shafto
was smoking quietly at a window, and to all
appearance intent on watching the towering
rock and batteries of the Castle, bathed in
morning sunshine&mdash;batteries whereon steel
morions and Scottish spears had often gleamed
of old.
</p>

<p>
Though his soul shrank from doing so,
Florian could not resist taking Shafto into
his confidence about this unexplainable event;
and the latter acted astonishment to the life!
</p>

<p>
Was the locket thus returned through the
post in obedience to her father's orders, after
he had probably discovered the contents of it?
</p>

<p>
But Shafto demolished this hope by drawing
his attention to the tenor of the pithy
scrap of paper, which precluded the idea that
it had been done under any other influence
than her own change of mind.
</p>

<p>
'Poor Florian!' sneered Shafto, as he
prepared to take his departure for Craigengowan;
'now you had better proceed at once to
cultivate the wear-the-willow state of mind.'
</p>

<p>
Florian made no reply.  His ideas of faith
and truth and of true women were suddenly
and cruelly shattered now!
</p>

<p>
'She has killed all that was good in me,
and the mischief of the future will be at her
door!' he exclaimed, in a low and husky
voice.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, Florian, don't say that,' said Shafto,
who actually did feel a little for him; and
just then, when they were on the eve of
separation, even his false and artful heart did
feel a pang, with the sting of fear, at the
career of falsehood to which he had committed
himself; but his ambition, innate greed,
selfishness, and pride urged him on that
career steadily and without an idea of flinching.
</p>

<p>
After Mr. Kippilaw's remarks concerning
how the face of Florian interested him, and
actually that he bore a likeness to the dead
Major&mdash;to his own father, in fact&mdash;Shafto
became more than desirous to be rid of him
in any way.  He thought with dread of the
discovery and fate of 'the Claimant,' and of
the fierce light thrown by the law on that
gigantic imposture; but genuine compunction
he had none!
</p>

<p>
'Well,' he muttered, as he drove away from
the hotel with his portmanteau, 'I must
keep up this game at all hazards now.  I
have stolen&mdash;not only Florian's name&mdash;but
his place, so let him paddle his own
canoe!'
</p>

<p>
'I'll write you from Craigengowan,' were
his parting words&mdash;a promise which he never
fulfilled.  Shafto, who generally held their
mutual purse now, might have offered to
supply the well-nigh penniless lad with money,
but he did not.  He only longed to be rid of
him&mdash;to hear of him no more.  He had a
dread of his presence, of his society, of his
very existence, and now had but one hope,
wish, and desire&mdash;that Florian Melfort should
cross his path never again.  And now that
he had achieved a separation between him
and Dulcie, he conceived that Florian would
never again go near Revelstoke, of which
he&mdash;Shafto&mdash;had for many reasons a nervous
dread!
</p>

<p>
Full of Dulcie and her apparently cruel
desertion of him, which he considered due to
calm consideration of his change of fortune&mdash;or
rather total want of it&mdash;Florian felt numbly
indifferent to the matter Shafto had in hand
and all about himself.
</p>

<p>
While very nearly moved to girlish tears at
parting from one with whom he had lived
since infancy&mdash;with whom he had shared the
same sleeping-room, shared in the same sports
and studies&mdash;with whom he had read the
same books to some extent, and had ever
viewed as a brother&mdash;Florian was rather
surprised, even shocked, by the impatience
of that kinsman, the only one he had in all
the wide world, to part from him and begone,
and to see he was calm and hard as flint or
steel.
</p>

<p>
'Different natures have different ways of
showing grief, I suppose,' thought the simple
Florian; 'or can it be that he still has a
grudge at me because of the false but winsome
Dulcie?  If affection for me is hidden
in his heart, it is hidden most skilfully.'  No
letter ever came from Craigengowan.  The
pride of Florian was justly roused, and he
resolved that he would not take the initiative,
and attempt to open a correspondence with
one who seemed to ignore him, and whose
manner at departing he seemed to see more
clearly and vividly now.
</p>

<p>
The fact soon became grimly apparent.
He could not remain idling in such a fashionable
hotel as the Duke of Rothesay, so he
settled his bill there, and took his portmanteau
in his hand, and issued into the streets&mdash;into
the world, in fact.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
SHAFTO IN CLOVER.
</h3>

<p>
About six months had elapsed since Shafto
and Florian parted, as we have described, at
Edinburgh.
</p>

<p>
It was June now.  The luxurious woods
around Craigengowan were in all their leafy
beauty, and under their shadows the dun
deer panted in the heat as they made their
lair among the feathery braken; the emerald
green lawn was mowed and rolled till it was
smooth as a billiard-table and soft as
three-pile velvet.
</p>

<p>
The air was laden with the wafted fragrance
of roses and innumerable other flowers; and
the picturesque old house, with its multitude
of conical turrets furnished with glittering
vanes, its crow-stepped gables and massive
chimneys, stood boldly up against the deep
blue sky of summer; and how sweetly peaceful
looked the pretty village, seen in middle
distance, through a foliated vista in the
woodlands, with the white smoke ascending
from its humble hearths, the only thing that
seemed to be stirring there; and how beautiful
were the colours some of its thatched
roofs presented&mdash;greenest moss, brown lichen,
and stonecrop, now all a blaze of gold, while
the murmur of a rivulet (a tributary of the
Esk), that gurgled under its tiny arch, 'the
auld brig-stane' of Lennard's boyhood, would
be heard at times, amid the pleasant voices
of some merrymakers on the lawn, amid the
glorious shrubberies, and belts of flowers
below the stately terrace, that had long since
replaced the moat that encircled the old
fortified mansion, from whence its last Jacobite
lord had ridden forth to fight and die for
James VIII., on the field of Sheriffmuir&mdash;King
of Scotland, England, France, and
Ireland, as the unflinching Jacobites had it.
</p>

<p>
A gay and picturesquely dressed lawn-tennis
party was busy tossing the balls from
side to side among several courts; but apart
from all, and almost conspicuously so&mdash;a
young fellow, in a handsome light tennis suit
of coloured flannels, and a beautiful girl were
carrying on a very palpable flirtation.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman was Shafto, and his companion
was Finella Melfort, Cosmo's orphan
daughter (an heiress through her mother),
who had returned a month before from a
protracted visit in Tyburnia.  They seemed
to be on excellent terms with each other, and
doubtless the natural gaiety of the girl's
disposition, her vivacity of manner, and their
supposed mutual relationship, had opened the
way to speedy familiarity.
</p>

<p>
She was a dark-haired and dark-eyed, but
very white-skinned little beauty, with a perfect
<i>mignonne</i> face, a petite but round and compact
figure, gracefully formed, and very
coquettish and <i>spirituelle</i> in all her ways.
</p>

<p>
She had received her peculiar Christian
name at the special request of her grandfather,
that silly peer being desirous that her name
might go down in the peerage in connection
with that of the famous Finella of Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
'A winsome pair they would make,' was
the smiling remark of Mr. Kenneth Kippilaw,
who was of the party (with three romping
daughters from Edinburgh), to Lord Fettercairn,
who smirked a grim assent, as if it
was a matter of indifference to him, which
it was not, as his legal adviser very well
knew; and my Lady Drumshoddy, who heard
the remark, bestowed upon him a bright
and approving smile in return for a knowing
glance through the glasses of his gold
<i>pince-nez</i>.
</p>

<p>
In Craigengowan the adventurous Shafto
Gyle had found his veritable Capua&mdash;he was
literally 'in clover.'  Yet he never heard
himself addressed by his assumed name
without experiencing a strange sinking and
fluttering of the heart.
</p>

<p>
The once-despised Lennard Melfort's
sword, his commission, and his hard-won
medals earned in Central India and the Terai
of Nepaul were now looked upon as precious
relics in his mother's luxurious boudoir at
Craigengowan, and reclaimed from the
lumber-attic, his portrait, taken in early life,
was again hung in a place of honour in the
dining-hall.
</p>

<p>
'What a fool my old uncle was to lose his
claim on such a place as this, and all for the
face of a girl!' was the exclamation of Shafto
to himself when first he came to Craigengowan,
and then he looked fearfully around
him lest the word <i>uncle</i> might have been
overheard by some one; and he thought&mdash;'If
rascally the trick I have played my simple
and love-stricken cousin&mdash;and rascally it was
and is&mdash;surely it was worth while to be the
heir of this place, Craigengowan.  To reckon
as mine in future all this grand panorama of
heath-clad hills, of green and golden fields,
of purple muirland, and stately woods of oak
and pine where the deer rove in herds; as
mine the trout-streams that flow towards the
Bervie; the cascades that roar down the
cliffs; the beautiful old house, with its stables,
kennels, and terrace; its cellars, pictures,
plate, and jewellery, old china and vases of
marble and jasper, china and Japanese work;
and I possess all that rank and wealth can
give!' and so thought this avaricious rascal,
with a capacity for evil actions far beyond his
years.
</p>

<p>
To the fair inheritance he had come to
steal he could not, however, add as his the
blue sky above it, or the waves of the German
Sea, which the North Esk flowed to join;
but he was not without sense appreciative
enough to enjoy the fragrance of the teeming
earth, of the pine forests where the brown
squirrels leaped from branch to branch, and
on the mountain side the perfume of the
golden whin and gorse.
</p>

<p>
Appraising everything, these ideas were
ever recurring to his mind, and it was full of
them now as he looked around him, and at
times, like one in a dream, heard the pretty
babble of the high-bred, coquettish girl, who,
to amuse herself, made <i>œillades</i> at him; who
called him so sweetly 'Cousin Shafto,' and
who, with her splendid fortune, he was now
beginning to include among the many goods
and chattels which must one day accrue to him.
</p>

<p>
Lord and Lady Fettercairn were, of course,
fully twenty years older than when we saw
them last, full of wrath and indignation at
Lennard for his so-called <i>mésalliance</i>.  Both
were cold in heart and self-absorbed in nature
as ever.  The latter was determined to be a
beauty still, though now upon the confines of
that decade 'when the cunning of cosmetics
can no longer dissemble the retribution of
Time the avenger.'  The former was bald
now, and the remains of his once sandy-coloured
hair had become grizzled, and a
multitude of puckers were about his cold,
grey eyes, while there was a perceptible
stoop in his whilom flat, square shoulders.
</p>

<p>
He was as full of family pride as ever, and
the discovery of an unexpected and authentic
heir and grandson to his title, that had never
been won in the field or cabinet, but was
simply the reward of bribery and corruption,
and for which not one patriotic act had been
performed by four generations, had given
him intense satisfaction, and caused much
blazing of bonfires and consumption of alcohol
about the country-side; and smiles that were
bright and genuine frequently wreathed the
usually pale and immobile face of Lady
Fettercairn when they rested on Shafto.
</p>

<p>
We all know how the weak and easy adoption
of a pretender by a titled mother in a
famous and most protracted case not many
years ago caused the most peculiar
complications; thus Lady Fettercairn was more
pardonable, posted up as she was with
documentary evidence, in accepting Shafto Gyle
as her grandson.
</p>

<p>
We have described her as being singularly,
perhaps aristocratically, cold.  As a mother,
she had never been given to kissing, caressing,
or fondling her two sons (as she did a
succession of odious pugs and lap-dogs), but,
throwing their little hearts back upon
themselves, left nurses and maids to 'do all that
sort of tiresome thing.'
</p>

<p>
So Finella, though an heiress, came in for
very little of it either, with all her sweetness,
beauty, and pretty winning ways, even
from Lord Fettercairn.  In truth, the man
who cared so little for his own country and
her local and vital interests was little likely
to care much for any flesh and blood that did
not stand in his own boots.
</p>

<p>
Lady Fettercairn heard from her 'grand-son'
from time to time with&mdash;for her&mdash;deep
apparent sympathy, and much genuine aristocratic
regret and indignation, much of the
obscure story of his boyhood and past life, at
least so much as he chose to tell her; and
she bitterly resented that Lennard Melfort
should have sought to put the 'nephew of
that woman, Flora MacIan,' into the army,
while placing 'his own son' Shafto into the
office of a miserable village lawyer, and so
forth&mdash;and so forth!
</p>

<p>
Fortunate it was, she thought, that all this
happened in an obscure village in Devonshire,
and far away from Craigengowan and all its
aristocratic surroundings.
</p>

<p>
She also thought it strange that
Shafto&mdash;('Whence came that name?' she would
mutter angrily)&mdash;should be so unlike her
dark and handsome Lennard.  His eyebrows
were fair and heavy; his eyes were a pale,
watery grey; his lips were thin, his neck
thick, and his hair somewhat sandy in hue.
Thus, she thought, he was not unlike what
her husband, the present Lord Fettercairn,
must have been at the same age.
</p>

<p>
As for the Peer himself, he was only too
thankful that an heir had turned up for his
ill-gotten coronet, and that now&mdash;so far as one
life was concerned&mdash;Sir Bernard Burke would
not rate it among the dormant and attainted
titles&mdash;those of the best and bravest men that
Scotland ever knew.
</p>

<p>
As for their mutual scheme concerning
Shafto and their granddaughter Finella, with
her beauty and many attractive parts, the
former was craftily most desirous of furthering
it, knowing well that, <i>happen what might</i>
in the future, she was an heiress; that
marriage with her would give him a firm
hold on the Fettercairn family, though the
money of her mother was wisely settled on
the young lady herself.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Finella had not been many
weeks home from London, at Craigengowan,
before Lady Fettercairn opened the trenches,
and spoke pretty plainly to him on the
subject.
</p>

<p>
Waving her large fan slowly to and fro,
and eyeing Shafto closely over the top of it,
she said:
</p>

<p>
'I hope, my dearest boy, that you will find
your cousin Finella&mdash;the daughter of my
dead darling Cosmo&mdash;a lovable kind of girl.
But even were she not so&mdash;and all say she
is&mdash;you must not feel a prejudice against her,
because&mdash;because&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What, grandmother?'
</p>

<p>
'Because it is our warmest desire that you
may marry her.'
</p>

<p>
'Why, haven't I money enough?' asked
Shafto, with one of his dissembling smiles.
</p>

<p>
'Of course, as the heir of Fettercairn; but
one is always the better to have more, and
you must not feel&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'What?' asked Shafto, with affected impatience.
</p>

<p>
'Please not to interrupt me thus.  I mean
that you must not be prejudiced against her
as an expected<i> parti</i>.'
</p>

<p>
'Why should I?'
</p>

<p>
'One hears and reads so much of such
things.'
</p>

<p>
'In novels, I suppose; but as she is so
pretty and eligible, why the dickens&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Shafto!'
</p>

<p>
'What now?' he asked, with some irritability,
as she often took him to task for his
solecisms.
</p>

<p>
'Dickens is not a phrase to use.  Exclamations
that were suited to the atmosphere
of Mr. Carlyon's office in Devonshire will
not do in Craigengowan!'
</p>

<p>
'Well&mdash;she won't look at me with your
eyes, grandmother.'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;her eyes&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'They will never seem so bright and
beautiful.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh, you flattering pet!' exclaimed my
Lady Fettercairn, with a smile and pleased
flush on her old wrinkled face, for her 'pet'
had soon discovered that she was far from
insensible to adulation.
</p>

<p>
Shafto certainly availed himself of the
opportunities afforded by 'cousinship,'
propinquity, and residence together in a country
house, and sought to gain a place in the good
graces or heart of Finella; but with all his
cunning and earnest wishes in the matter&mdash;apart
from the wonderful beauty of the girl&mdash;he
feared that he made no more progress
with her than he had done with Dulcie Carlyon.
</p>

<p>
She talked, played, danced, and even
romped with him; they rambled and read
together, and were as much companions as
any two lovers would be; but he felt nearly
certain that though she flirted with him,
because it was partly her habit to appear to
do so with most men, whenever he attempted
to become tender she openly laughed at him
or changed the subject skilfully; and also
that if he essayed to touch or take her hand
it was very deliberately withdrawn from his
reach, and never did she make him more
sensible of all this than when he contrived to
draw her aside to the terrace on the afternoon
of the lawn-tennis party.
</p>

<p>
She had long ere this been made perfectly
aware that love and marriage were objects of
all his attention, yet she amused herself with
him by her coquettish <i>œillades</i> and waggish
speeches.
</p>

<p>
'Finella,' said he, in a low and hesitating
voice, as he stooped over her, 'I hope that
with all your flouting, and pretty, flippant
mode of treating me, you will see your way
to carry out the fondest desire of my heart
and that of our grandparents.'
</p>

<p>
'Such a fearfully elaborate speech!  And
the object to which I am to see my way is to
marry you, cousin Shafto?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes,' said he, bending nearer to her
half-averted ear.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks very much, dear Shafto; but I
couldn't think of such a thing.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?  Am I so distasteful to you?'
</p>

<p>
'Not at all; but for cogent reasons of my own.'
</p>

<p>
'And these are?'
</p>

<p>
'Firstly, people should marry to please
themselves, not others.  Grandpapa and
grandmamma did, and so shall I; and I am
quite independent enough to do as I please
and choose.'
</p>

<p>
'In short, you will not or cannot love me?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said so, you tiresome Shafto!'
said she, looking upward at him with one of
her sweetest and most bewitching smiles.
</p>

<p>
'Then I have some hope, dear Finella?'
</p>

<p>
'I have not said that either.'
</p>

<p>
'You may yet love me, then?'
</p>

<p>
'No; not as you wish it.'
</p>

<p>
'But why?'
</p>

<p>
'You have no right to ask me.'
</p>

<p>
His fair beetling eyebrows knit, and a
gleam came into his cold, grey eyes as he
asked, after a pause:
</p>

<p>
'Is there anyone else you prefer?'
</p>

<p>
'You have no right to inquire,' replied she,
and a keener observer might have detected
that his question brought a tiny blush to her
cheek and a fond smile to her curved lips; 'so
please to let this matter drop, once and for
ever, dear Shafto, and we can be such
delightful friends&mdash;such jolly cousins.'
</p>

<p>
And so ended one of many such conversations
on this topic&mdash;conversations that
developed indifference, if not quite aversion,
on the part of Finella, the clue to which
Shafto was fated to find in a few weeks after.

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
VIVIAN HAMMERSLEY.
</h3>

<p>
The persistent attentions of Shafto were
alternately a source of amusement and worry
to Finella Melfort; and when she found them
become the latter, she had more than once
retreated to the residence of her maternal
grandmother, Lady Drumshoddy, though she
infinitely preferred being at Craigengowan,
where the general circle was more refined
and of a much better style; for Lady
Drumshoddy&mdash;natheless her title&mdash;was not quite
one of the 'upper ten,' being only the widow
of an advocate, who, having done without
scruple the usual amount of work to please
his party and the Lord Advocate, had been
rewarded therefor by an appointment (and
knighthood) in Bengal, where he had gone,
at a lucky time, with the old advice and
idea&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'They bade me from the Rupee Tree<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pluck India's endless riches,<br />
  And then I swore that time should see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huge pockets in my breeches.'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Thus Sir Duncan Drumshoddy's pockets
were so well filled that when he came home
to die, his daughter was heiress enough to be
deemed a 'great catch' by the Fettercairn
family, though her grandfather had been&mdash;no
one knew precisely what.
</p>

<p>
And now Finella, by education, careful
training, and by her own habit of thought,
was naturally so refined that, with all her
waggery and disposition to laughter and
merriment, Shafto's clumsy love-speeches
occasionally irritated her.
</p>

<p>
'I have somewhere read,' said he, 'that a
man may get the love of the girl he wants,
even if she cares little for him, if he only
asks her at the right time; but, so far as you
are concerned, Finella, the right moment has
not come for me, I suppose.'
</p>

<p>
'Nor ever will come, I fear, cousin Shafto,'
she replied, fanning herself, and eyeing him
with mingled fun and defiance sparkling in
her dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
Ere Shafto could resume on this occasion
Lord Fettercairn came hurriedly to him, saying,
</p>

<p>
'Oh, by-the-bye, young Hammersley,
from London, will arrive here to-morrow for
a few weeks' grouse-shooting before he
leaves for his regiment in Africa.  You will
do your best to be attentive to him, Shafto.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course,' said the latter, rather sulkily,
however, all the more so that he was quick
enough to detect that, at the mention of the
visitor's name, a flush like a wave of colour
crossed the cheek of Finella.
</p>

<p>
Something in his tone attracted the
attention of Lord Fettercairn, who said,
</p>

<p>
'After the 12th I hope you will find a
legitimate use for your gun&mdash;you know what
I mean.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto coloured deeply with annoyance, as
his grandfather referred to a mischievous act
of his, which was deemed a kind of outrage
in the neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
In the ruins of Finella's Castle at Fettercairn
a pair of majestic osprey had built their
nest, guarded by the morass around them,
and there they bred and reared a pair of
beautiful eaglets.  No one had been allowed
to approach them, so that nothing should
occur to break the confidence of safety which
the pair of osprey acquired in their lonely
summer haunt, till soon after Shafto came to
Craigengowan, and by four rounds from his
breech-loader he contrived to shoot them all,
to the indignation of the neighbourhood and
even of my Lord Fettercairn.
</p>

<p>
Not that the latter cared a straw about
these eagles as objects of natural history; but
the fact of their existence formed the subject
of newspaper paragraphs, and his vanity was
wounded on finding that one of his family
had acted thus.
</p>

<p>
So on the morrow, at luncheon, the family
circle at Craigengowan had two or three
accessions to its number&mdash;friends invited for
the 12th of August&mdash;among others Mr. Kippilaw
the younger, a spruce and dapper
Edinburgh Writer to the Signet, 'who,'
Shafto said, 'thought no small beer of
himself;' and Vivian Hammersley, a captain of
the Warwickshire regiment, a very attractive
and, to one who was present, most decided
addition to their society.
</p>

<p>
His regular features were well tanned by
the sun in Natal; his dark hair was shorn
short; his moustaches were pointed well out;
and his dark eyes had a bright and merry yet
firm and steady expression, as those of a man
born to command men, who had more than
once faced danger, and was ready to face it
again.
</p>

<p>
He was in his twenty-seventh year, and
was every way a courteous and finished
English gentleman, though Shafto, in his
secret heart, and more than once in the
stables, pronounced him to be 'a conceited
beast.'
</p>

<p>
Hammersley had fished in Norway, shot
big game in Southern Africa, hunted in the
English shires, taking his fences&mdash;even double
ones&mdash;like a bird; he had lost and won with a
good grace at Ascot and the Clubs, flirted 'all
round,' and, though far from rich, was a good
specimen of a handsome, open-handed, and
open-hearted young officer, a favourite with
all women, and particularly with his regiment.
</p>

<p>
After luncheon he was seated beside Lady
Fettercairn; he was too wise in his generation
to have placed himself where he would have
wished, beside Finella, whose little hand, on
entering, Shafto thought he retained in his
rather longer than etiquette required; for if
Shafto's eyes were shifty, they were particularly
sharp, and he soon found that though
Finella, to a certain extent, had filled up her
time by flirting in a cousinly way with himself,
'now that this fellow Hammersley had come,'
he was 'nowhere' as he thought, with a very
bad word indeed.
</p>

<p>
We have said that Finella had paid a
protracted and&mdash;to her&mdash;most enjoyable visit
to Tyburnia.  There at balls, garden parties,
and in the Row she had met Vivian Hammersley
repeatedly; and these meetings had
not been without a deep and tender interest
to them both; and when they were parted
finally by her return to Craigengowan, though
no declaration of regard had escaped him, he
had been burning to speak to her in that
sweet and untutored language by which the
inmost secrets of the loving heart can be read;
and now that they had met again, they had
a thousand London objects to talk about
safely in common, which made them seem to
be what they were, quite old friends in fact,
and erelong Lady Fettercairn began, like
Shafto, to listen and look darkly and doubtfully on.
</p>

<p>
But when they were alone, which was seldom,
or merely apart from others, there was
between them a new consciousness now&mdash;a
secret but sweet understanding, born of eye
speaking to eye&mdash;all the sweeter for its
secrecy and being all their own, a conscious
emotion that rendered them at times almost
afraid to speak or glance lest curious eyes or
ears might discover what that secret was.
</p>

<p>
What was to be the sequel to all this?
Hammersley was far from rich according to
the standard of wealth formed by Lady
Fettercairn, and the latter had destined her
granddaughter with all her accumulated
wealth to be the bride of Shafto.
Hammersley knew nothing of this; he only knew
his own shortcoming in the matter of 'pocketability;'
but then youth, we are told, 'is
sanguine and full of faith and hope in an
untried future.  It looks out over the pathway
of life towards the goal of its ambition, seeing
only the end desired, and giving little or no
heed to hills and dales, storms and accidents,
that may be met with on the way.'  So,
happy in the good fortune that threw him
once more in the sweet society of bright
Finella Melfort, Captain Hammersley gave
full swing in secret to the most delightful of
day-dreams.
</p>

<p>
In all this, however, we are somewhat
anticipating our narrative.
</p>

<p>
But, like a wise man, while the luncheon
lasted he was most attentive to his hostess,
from whose old but still handsome face, like
that of Tennyson's Maud, 'so faultily faultless,
icily regular, and splendidly null,' he ever and
anon turned to that of Finella&mdash;that <i>mignonne</i>
face, which was so full of varying expression,
warmth, light, and colour.
</p>

<p>
'Try that Madeira, Captain Hammersley,'
said Lord Fettercairn.  'You will scarcely
credit how long I have had it in the cellar.
I bought a whole lot of it&mdash;when was it,
Grapeston?' he asked, turning to the solemn
old butler behind him.
</p>

<p>
'The year Mr. Lennard left home, my Lord.'
</p>

<p>
'Everything at Craigengowan seems to
take date before or after that event,' said
Lord Fettercairn, with knitted brow.  'Do
you mean for India, Grapeston?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, my lord,' replied the butler, who
had carried 'Master Lennard' in his arms as a baby.
</p>

<p>
'Such a rich flavour it has, and just glance
at the colour.'
</p>

<p>
Hammersley affected to do so, but his eyes
were bent on the face of Finella.
</p>

<p>
'I hope you won't find Craigengowan dull,
but every place is so after London.'
</p>

<p>
'True, we live so fast there that we never
seem to have time to do anything.'
</p>

<p>
And now, understanding that Shafto was
to be his chief companion at the covies on
the morrow, Hammersley talked to him of
hammerless guns, of central fire, of the mode
of breaking in dogs, training setters, and so
forth; and as these subjects had not been
included in Shafto's education at Lawyer
Carlyon's office, he almost yawned as he
listened with irritation to what he could not comprehend.
</p>

<p>
'If you care for fishing, Hammersley,' said
Lord Fettercairn, 'the Bervie yields capital
salmon, sea and yellow trout.  Finella has
filled more than one basket with the latter,
but Shafto is somewhat of a duffer with his
rod&mdash;he breaks many a rod, and has never
landed a salmon yet.'
</p>

<p>
'And the shootings?' said Hammersley inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
'Well, the best in the county are Drumtochty,
Fasque, Hobseat, and my own, as I
hope you will find to-morrow.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;indeed, I am sure I shall.'
</p>

<p>
'I have close on 5,000 acres, and the
probable bag of grouse and black game is
from 400 to 500 brace.'
</p>

<p>
After dinner that evening Finella was
found singing at the piano&mdash;singing, as she
always did, without requiring pressure and
apparently for the mere pleasure of it, as a
thrush on a rose bush sings; but now she
sang for Vivian Hammersley, Shafto felt
instinctively that she did so, and his bitterness
was roused when he heard her, in a pause, whisper:
</p>

<p>
'Please, Captain Hammersley, let Shafto
turn the leaves.  He likes to do it, though he
can do little else in the way of music.'
</p>

<p>
This kind of confidence seemed to imply
foregone conclusions and a mutual understanding,
however slight; but, to some extent,
Finella had a kind of dread of Shafto.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley smiled and drew back, after
placing a piece of music before her; but not
before remarking:
</p>

<p>
'This song you are about to sing is not a new one.'
</p>

<p>
'No&mdash;it is old as the days when George
IV. was king&mdash;it is one you gave me some
weeks ago in London, you remember?'
</p>

<p>
'Am I likely to forget?'
</p>

<p>
'Turn the leaves, Shafto, please,' said
Finella, adjusting her dress over the
music-stool; 'but don't talk to me.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It interrupts one so; but turn the leaves
at the proper time.'
</p>

<p>
'Captain Hammersley will do that better
than I,' said Shafto, drawing almost sulkily
away, while the former resumed his place by
Finella, with an unmistakable smile rippling
over his face.
</p>

<p>
This song, which, it would seem, Hammersley
had given her, was an old one, long
since forgotten, named the 'Trysting Place,'
and jealous anger gathered in Shafto's heart
as he listened and heard Hammersley's voice
blend with Finella's in the last line of each
verse:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'We met not in the sylvan scene<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where lovers wish to meet,<br />
  Where skies are bright and woods are green,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And bursting blossoms sweet;<br />
  But in the city's busy din,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Mammon holds his reign,<br />
  Sweet intercourse we sought to win<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid fashion, guile, and gain;<br />
  Above us was a murky sky,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around a crowded space,<br />
  Yet dear, my love, to thee and me,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this, our <i>trysting place</i>.'<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'They are who say Love only dwells<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Mid sunshine, light, and flowers;<br />
  Alike to him are gloomy cells<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or gay and smiling bowers;<br />
  Love works not on insensate things<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His sweet and magic art;<br />
  No outward shrine arrests his wings,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His home is in the heart;<br />
  And dearest hearts like <i>thine</i> and <i>mine</i>,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With rapture must retrace&mdash;<br />
  How often Love has deigned to shine<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On this our <i>trysting place</i>.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
'Miss Melfort, you have sung it more
sweetly than ever!' said Hammersley in a
low voice as he bent over her.
</p>

<p>
'Confound him!' muttered Shafto to himself;
'where was this trysting place?  I feel
inclined to put a charge of shot into him
to-morrow.  I will, too, if the day is foggy!'
</p>

<p>
Finella, though pressed, declined to sing
more, as the Misses Kippilaw, who were
rather irrepressible young ladies, now
proposed a carpet-dance, and she drew on her
gloves; and while she fumbled away, almost
nervously, with the buttoning of one, she knew
that Hammersley's eyes were lovingly and
admiringly bent on her, till he came to the
rescue, and did the buttoning required; and
to Shafto it seemed the process was a very
protracted one, and was a pretty little
connivance, as in reality it was.
</p>

<p>
Miss Prim, Lady Fettercairn's companion,
was summoned, and she&mdash;poor creature&mdash;had
to furnish music for the occasion, till at
last Finella good-naturedly relieved her.
</p>

<p>
So a carpet-dance closed the evening, and
then Shafto, though an indifferent waltzer,
thought he might excel in a square dance
with Finella; but he seldom shone in conversation
at any time, and on this occasion his
attempts at it proved a great failure, and
when he compared this with the animation of
Hammersley and Finella in the Lancers, he
was greatly puzzled and secretly annoyed.
The former did not seem to undergo that
agony so often felt by Shafto, of having
out-run all the topics of conversation, or to have
to rack his brain for anecdotes or jokes, but
to be able to keep up an easy flow of
well-bred talk on persons, places, and things,
which seemed to amuse Finella excessively,
as she smiled brightly and laughed merrily
while fanning herself, and looking more
sparkling and piquante than ever.
</p>

<p>
'What the deuce can he find to say to
her?' thought Shafto; but Hammersley was
only finding the links&mdash;the threads of a dear
old story begun in London months ago.
</p>

<p>
So passed the first day of Hammersley's
arrival at Craigengowan, and Finella laid her
head on her pillow full of bright and happy
thoughts, in which 'Cousin Shafto' bore no
share.
</p>

<p>
But while these emotions and events were
in progress, where, in the meantime, was
Florian?  Ay, Shafto Gyle, where?
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap13"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
AMONG THE GROUSE.
</h3>

<p>
Nathless the vengeful thoughts of the
unamiable Shafto and his threats muttered in
secret, the shooting next day passed off
without any peril being encountered by
the unconscious Hammersley&mdash;unconscious at
least of the enmity his presence was inspiring.
However, it was not so the second; and
Finella and her fair friends agreed that if he
looked so well and handsome in his heather-coloured
knickerbocker shooting-dress, with
ribbed stockings of Alloa yarn, his gun under
his arm, and shot-belt over his shoulder, how
gallant must he look when in full uniform.
</p>

<p>
In the field the vicinity of Shafto was
avoided as much as possible, as he shot wildly
indeed.  By the gamekeepers, servants, and
people generally on the estate he was simply
detested for the severity of his manner, his
tyranny, his disposition to bully, and meanness
in every way; though at first, when he came
to Craigengowan, they had laboured in vain,
and vied with each other in their attempts
to initiate him into those field-sports so dear
to Britons generally, and to the Scots in
particular; but when shooting grouse
especially, the beaters or 'drivers' had genuine
dread of him, and, when fog was on, sometimes
refused to attend him, and he was, as
they said among themselves, 'a new
experience i' the Howe o' the Mearns.'
</p>

<p>
'I've seen as fu' a haggis toomed on a
midden,' said the old head-gamekeeper wrathfully,
as he drew his bonnet over his beetling
brows, 'but I'll keep my mind to mysel', and
tell my tale to the wind that blaws o'er
Craigengowan.'
</p>

<p>
Though well past sixty now, Lord Fettercairn,
hale and hearty, was in the field with
his central-fire gun with fine Damascus
barrels.  Shafto, Hammersley, young Kippilaw,
and four others made up the party.
</p>

<p>
The morning was a lovely one, and lovely
too was the scenery, for August is a month
richly tinted with the last touches of summer,
blended with the russet tones of autumn; the
pleasant meadows are yet green, and over the
ripened harvest the breeze murmurs like the
ocean when nearly asleep.
</p>

<p>
Apart from the joyous exhilaration of
shooting, and that out-door exercise so dear
to every English gentleman, Vivian
Hammersley felt all that which comes from the
romantic beauty of his surroundings&mdash;the
scenery of the Howe of the Mearns, which
is a low champaign and highly cultivated
country, studded with handsome mansions,
and ornamented by rich plantations and
thriving villages.
</p>

<p>
Ere long the open muirs were reached, and
the hill-sides, the steep, purple ridges of
which the sportsmen had to breast; and,
keen sportsman though he was, Hammersley
had soon to admit that grouse-shooting was
the most fatiguing work he had yet
encountered; but soon came the excitements of
the first point, the first brood, and the first
shot or two.
</p>

<p>
To the eye chiefly accustomed to brown
partridges, grouse look dusky and even black,
and they seem to hug the purple heather, but
when one becomes accustomed to them they
are as easy to knock over as the tame birds;
and now the crack of the guns began to ring
out along the hill-slopes.
</p>

<p>
Shafto and Hammersley were about twenty
yards apart, and twice when a bird rose
before the latter, it was brought down
wounded but not killed by the former.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley felt that this was 'bad form,'
as Shafto should not have fired, unless he
had missed or passed it; but he only bit his
lip and smiled disdainfully.  Lord Fettercairn
remarked the discourtesy, and added,
</p>

<p>
'Shafto, I do wish you would take an
example from Captain Hammersley.'
</p>

<p>
'In what way?' grumbled Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'He kills his game clean&mdash;few birds
run from him with broken wings and so
forth.'
</p>

<p>
'I am glad to hit when I can,' said Shafto,
whose mode of life in Devonshire had made
him rather soft, and he was beginning to
think that nerves of iron and lungs like a
bagpipe were requisite for breasting up the
hill-slopes, and then shoot straight at anything.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley worked away silently, neither
looking to his right nor left, feeling that
though several elements are requisite for
'sport,' the chief then was to kill as much
grouse as possible in a given time, but was
more than once irritated and discomposed by
Shafto, and even young Kippilaw, shooting in
a blundering way along the line even when
the birds were not flying high; and he
proceeded in a workmanlike way to bring
down one bird as it approached, the next
when it was past him, and so on.
</p>

<p>
The first portion of the day the Fettercairn
party shot to points, and then to drivers, and
in their fear of Shafto's wild shooting, the
latter kept shouting while driving, and, as he
loathed the whole thing, and was now
'completely blown&mdash;pumped out,' as he phrased it,
he was not sorry when the magic word
'lunch' was uttered; and Hammersley
certainly hailed it, for with the lunch came
Finella, and with her arrival&mdash;to him&mdash;the
most delightful part of the day.
</p>

<p>
She came tooling along the sunny pathway
that traversed the bottom of a glen, driving
with her tightly gauntleted and deft little
hands a pair of beautiful white ponies, which
drew the daintiest of basket-phaetons,
containing also Mr. Grapeston and an ample
luncheon-basket; and the place chosen for
halting was a green oasis amid the dark
heather, where a spring of deliciously cool
water was bubbling up, called Finella's Well.
</p>

<p>
'Now, gentlemen,' said Lord Fettercairn,
'please to draw your cartridges.  I was once
nearly shot in this very place by a stupid
fellow who omitted to do so.  So glad you
have come, Finella darling, we are all hungry
as hawks, and thirsty too.'
</p>

<p>
Lovely indeed did the piquante girl look
in her coquettish hat and well-fitting jacket,
while the drive, the occasion, and the touch
of Hammersley's hand as he assisted her to
alight gave her cheek an unwonted colour,
and lent fresh lustre to her dark eyes, and
the soldier thought that certainly there was
nothing in the world so pleasant to a man's
eye as a young, well-dressed, and beautiful girl.
</p>

<p>
'You have had good sport,' said she to the
group, while her eye rested on Hammersley,
and then on the rows of grouse laid by braces
on the grass; and she 'brought a breeze
with her,' as the gentlemen thought, and had
a pleasant remark for each.  Her mode of
greeting the members of the party was
different, as to some she gave her hand like
a little queen, while to others she smiled, or
simply bowed; but provoked an angry snort
from Shafto by expressing a hope that he
'had not shot anyone yet.'
</p>

<p>
And then he grew white as he recalled his
angry thoughts of the preceding night.
</p>

<p>
'Why did you take the trouble to drive
here?' he asked her, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
'Because I chose to come; and I do so
love driving these plump darlings of ponies,'
replied the girl, patting the sleek animals
with her tiny, slim hand.
</p>

<p>
'Old Grapeston would have done well
enough; and why did you not bring one of
the Kippilaw girls?'
</p>

<p>
'They are at lawn-tennis.  If I thought I
could please you&mdash;not an easy task&mdash;I should
have tried to bring them all, though that is
rather beyond the capacities of my phaeton.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto never for a moment doubted that
she had come over to superintend the
luncheon because 'that fellow Hammersley'
was one of the party; and in this suspicion
perhaps he was right.
</p>

<p>
As for Hammersley, being ignorant of
Shafto's antecedents, his present hopes, and
those of Lady Fettercairn, he could not
comprehend how the grandson and heir-apparent
of a peer came to be 'such bad form&mdash;bad
style, and all that sort of thing,' as he
thought; and all that became rather worse
when Shafto was under the influence of
sundry bumpers of iced Pommery Greno
administered by Mr. Grapeston.
</p>

<p>
As the sportsmen lounged on the grass,
and the luncheon proceeded under the
superintendence of old Jasper Grapeston,
Finella, the presiding goddess, looked
unusually bright and happy&mdash;a consummation
which Shafto never doubted, in his rage and
jealousy, came of the presence of Vivian
Hammersley, and that her brilliance was all
the result of another man's society&mdash;not his
certainly, and hence he would have preferred
that she was not light-hearted at all.
</p>

<p>
He could see that with all her <i>espieglerie</i>
Finella found no occasion to laugh at
Hammersley or tease or snub that gentleman as
she did himself, but the attentions of
Hammersley were delicately and seductively paid.
Deferential and gentle at all times, to all
women, he had always been so to Finella
Melfort, and she was able to feel more than
his words, looks, or manner suggested to
others; and he imagined&mdash;nay, he was
becoming certain&mdash;and a glow of great joy came
with the certainty&mdash;that Finella's sweet dark
eyes grew brighter at his approach; that a
rose-leaf tinge crossed her delicate cheek, and
there came a slight quiver into her voice
when she replied to him,
</p>

<p>
'Was it all really so?'
</p>

<p>
Fate was soon to decide that which he had
been too slow or timid to decide for himself.
</p>

<p>
As he said one of the merest commonplaces
to her, their eyes met.
</p>

<p>
It was only one lingering glance!
</p>

<p>
But looks can say so much more than the
voice, the eyes surpassing the lips, breaking
or revealing what the silence of months, it
may be years, has hidden, and leading heart
to heart.
</p>

<p>
'Grandpapa,' said Finella, suddenly, and
just before driving off, 'do you shoot over
this ground to-morrow?'
</p>

<p>
'To a certain extent we shall&mdash;but why?'
</p>

<p>
'Shall I bring the luncheon here?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, pet, to Finella's Well.'
</p>

<p>
'So, then, this shall be our trysting-place!'
said she, with a bow to all, and a merry
glance which included most certainly Vivian
Hammersley, to whom the landscape seemed
to darken with her departure.
</p>

<p>
'Now is the time for shooting to advantage,'
said Lord Fettercairn, who knew
by old experience that when the afternoon
shadows, and more especially those of evening,
begin to lengthen, the slopes of the hills are
seen better, that the birds, too, lie better,
and that as the air becomes more fresh and
cool, men can shoot with greater care and
deliberation than in the heat of noon.  But
Hammersley, full of his own thoughts, full of
the image of Finella and that tale-telling
glance they had exchanged, missed nearly
every bird, to the great exultation of Shafto,
who made an incredible number of bad and
clumsy jokes thereon&mdash;jokes which the young
Englishman heard with perfect indifference
and equanimity.
</p>

<p>
Shafto, however, scarcely foresaw the
result of the next day's expedition, and
certainly Hammersley did not do so either.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE TWO FINELLAS.
</h3>

<p>
Next day, when the grouse-shooting had
been in progress for an hour or two, a
mishap occurred to Hammersley.  He twisted
his ankle in a turnip-field, fell heavily on
one side, and staggered up too lame to take
further share in the sport for that day at
least.
</p>

<p>
'When Finella comes with the lunch in
the pony-phaeton, she will drive you home,'
said Lord Fettercairn, who then desired
one of the beaters to give Hammersley
the assistance of an arm to the well,
where the repast was to be laid out as
before.
</p>

<p>
When Shafto saw his rival limping he was
delighted, and thought, 'This will mar his
waltzing for a time at least;' but he was less
delighted when he heard of Lord Fettercairn's
natural suggestion.
</p>

<p>
'It is likely a cunning dodge,' was his next
thought, 'to get a quiet drive with her to
Craigengowan.'
</p>

<p>
And Finella's look and exclamation of
alarm and interest were not lost upon him
when she arrived and found Hammersley
seated on the grass by the side of the well,
and saw the difficulty with which he rose to
greet her, propping himself upon his unloaded
gun as he did so; and soft, indeed, was the
blush of pleasure that crossed her delicate
face when she heard of 'grandpapa's arrangement;'
and certainly it met, secretly, with the
entire approbation of Hammersley, who
anticipated with delight the drive home with such
a companion.
</p>

<p>
After a time the luncheon&mdash;though skilfully
protracted by Shafto&mdash;was over, and
Finella and her 'patient' were together in
the phaeton, and she, with a smile and farewell
bow, whipped up her petted ponies, Flirt
and Fairy, whom every day she fed with
apples and carrots.
</p>

<p>
Shafto thought jealously and sulkily that
she was in great haste to be gone; but more
sulky would he have been had he seen, or
known that when once an angle of the glen
was reached where the road dipped out of
sight, the ponies were permitted to go at
their own pace, which ere long dwindled into
a walk, till they passed the vast ruined castle
of Fettercairn.  Finella and Hammersley
were, however, if very happy, very silent,
though both enjoyed the drive in the bright
sunshine amid such beautiful scenery, and he
quite forgot his petty misfortune in contemplating
the delicate profile and long drooping
eyelashes of the girl who sat beside him, and
who, with a fluttering heart, was perhaps
expecting the avowal that trembled on his lips,
especially when he placed his hand on hers,
in pretence of guiding the ponies, which
broke into a rapid trot as the lodge gates
were passed; and glorious as the opportunity
accorded him had been, Hammersley's heart,
while burning with passionate ardour, seemed
to have lost all courage, for he had a sincere
dread of Lady Fettercairn, and suspected
that her interests were naturally centred in
Shafto.
</p>

<p>
At seven-and-twenty a man, who has
knocked about the world, with a regiment
especially, for some nine years or so, does
not fall over head and ears in love like a
rash boy, or without calculating his chances
of general success; and poor Hammersley,
though he did not doubt achieving it with
Finella herself, saw deadly rocks and breakers
ahead with her family, and his spirit was a
proud one.  To make a declaration was to
ruin or lose everything, for if the family were
averse to his suit he must, he knew, quit
their roof for ever, and Finella would be lost
to him, for heiresses seldom elope now, save
in novels; and he knew that in her circle the
motives for marriage are more various and
questionable than with other and untitled
ranks of life.  Rank and money were the
chief incentives of such people as the
Melforts of Fettercairn.  'Venal unions,'
says an essayist, 'no doubt occur in the
humbler classes, but love is more frequently
the incentive, while with princes and
patricians the conjugal alliance is, in nine
instances out of ten, a mere matter of <i>expedience</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Craigengowan was reached, and not a
word of the great secret that filled his heart
had escaped him, for which he cursed his
own folly and timidity when the drive ended,
and a groom took the ponies' heads.
</p>

<p>
Yet the day was not over, nor was a
fresh opportunity wanting.  Lady Fettercairn
and all her female quests had driven to a
flower-show at the nearest town&mdash;even
Mrs. Prim was gone, and the house was empty!
</p>

<p>
Everything in and about Craigengowan
seemed conducive to love-talk and
confidences.  The great and picturesque house
itself was charming.  The old orchards
would ere long be heavy with fruit, and were
then a sight to see; on the terrace the
peacocks were strutting to and fro; there were
fancy arbours admirably adapted for flirtation,
and a quaint old Scottish garden (with a sun
and moon dial) now gay with all the flowers
of August.
</p>

<p>
On a lounge near an open window facing
the latter Hammersley was reclining, when
Finella, after changing her driving dress,
came into the drawing-room, and finely her
costume suited her dark and piquante style
of beauty.  She wore a cream-coloured silk,
profusely trimmed with filmy lace, and a
cluster of scarlet flowers on the left shoulder
among the lace of the collarette that encircled
her slender neck; and Hammersley, as he
looked at her, thought that 'beauty
unadorned' was rather a fallacy.
</p>

<p>
His undisguised expression of admiration
as he partly rose to receive her caused her to
colour a little, as she inquired if his hurt was
easier now; but, instead of replying, he
said, while venturing slightly to touch her
hand:
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, Miss Melfort, how you came by
your dear pretty name of Finella?  Not
from Finella in "Peveril of the Peak"?'
</p>

<p>
'Ah, I am very unlike her!'
</p>

<p>
'You are certainly quite as charming!'
</p>

<p>
'But neither dumb nor pretending to be
so,' said the girl, with one of her silvery little
laughs.
</p>

<p>
'Finella!' said Hammersley, as if to
himself, in a low and unconsciously loving
tone; 'whence the name?  Is it a family one?'
</p>

<p>
'Don't you know?' she asked.
</p>

<p>
'How could I know?  I know only that I
will never forget it.'
</p>

<p>
'Of course you could not know.  The
origin of my name is one of the oldest legends
of the Howe of the Mearns.'
</p>

<p>
'Howe&mdash;that is Scotch for "hollow," I
believe.'
</p>

<p>
'No; "hollow" is the English for <i>howe</i>,'
replied Finella, laughing, as she recalled a
quip of Boucicault's to the same purpose.
'You saw the great old castle we passed in
our drive home?'
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'Well, I am called Finella from a lady who
lived there.'
</p>

<p>
'After it fell into ruin?'
</p>

<p>
'No; before it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then she must have lived a precious long
time ago.'
</p>

<p>
'She certainly did&mdash;some&mdash;nearly a
thousand years ago.'
</p>

<p>
'What a little quiz you are!  Now, Miss
Melfort, what joke is this?'
</p>

<p>
'No joke at all,' said she, quite seriously;
'you can read about it in our family history&mdash;or
I shall read it to you in the "Book of
Fettercairn."'
</p>

<p>
She took from a table near a handsome
volume, which her grandfather&mdash;to please
whom she was named Finella&mdash;had in a
spirit of family vanity prepared for private
circulation, and as if to connect his title with
antiquity, prefaced by a story well known in
ancient Scottish history, though little known
to the Scots of the present day.
</p>

<p>
We give it from his Lordship's book
verbatim as she read it to Vivian
Hammersley, who&mdash;cunning rogue&mdash;was not
indisposed with such a charming and
sympathetic companion as Finella to make the
most of his fall, and reclined rather luxuriously
on the velvet lounge, while she, seated in a
dainty little chair, read on; but he scarcely
listened, so intent was he on watching her
sweet face, her white and perfect ears, her
downcast eyelids with their long lashes&mdash;her
whole self!
</p>

<p>
The Melforts, Lords Fettercairn (Strathfinella)
and of that Ilk, take their hereditary
title from the old castle of that name, which
stands in the Howe of the Mearns, and is
sometimes called the Castle of Finella.  It
is situated on an eminence, and is now
surrounded on three sides by a morass.  It
is enclosed within an inner and an outer wall
of oblong form, and occupying half an acre of
ground.  The inner is composed of vitrified
matter, but no lime has been used in its
construction.  The walls are a congeries of
small stones cemented together by some
molten matter, now harder than the stones
themselves; and the remarkable event for
which this castle is celebrated in history is
the following:
</p>

<p>
When Kenneth III., a wise and valiant
king (who defeated the Danes at the battle
of Luncarty, and created on that field the
Hays, Earls of Errol, Hereditary Constables
of Scotland, and leaders of the Feudal
cavalry, thus originating also the noble
families of Tweeddale and Kinnoull), was on
the throne, his favourite residence was the
castle of Kincardine, the ruins of which still
remain about a mile eastward of the village
of Fettercairn, and from thence he went
periodically to pay his devotions at the
shrine of St. Palladius, Apostle of the Scots,
to whom the latter had been sent by Pope
Celestine in the sixth century to oppose
the Pelagian heresy, and whose bones at
Fordoun were enclosed in a shrine of gold
and precious stones in 1409 by the Bishop of
St. Andrews.
</p>

<p>
The king had excited the deadly hatred
of Finella, the Lady of Fettercairn, daughter
of the Earl of Angus, by having justly put to
death her son, who was a traitor and had
rebelled against him in Lochaber; and, with
the intention of being revenged, she prepared
at Fettercairn a singular engine or 'infernal
machine,' with which to slay the king.
</p>

<p>
This engine consisted of a brass statue,
which shot out arrows when a golden apple
was taken from its hand.
</p>

<p>
Kenneth was at Kincardine, engaged in
hunting the deer, wolf, the badger and the
boar, when she treacherously invited him to
her castle of Fettercairn, which was then,
as Buchanan records, 'pleasant with shady
groves and piles of curious buildings,' of
which there remained no vestiges when he
wrote in the days of James VI.; and thither
the king rode, clad in a rich scarlet mantle,
white tunic, an eagle's wing in his helmet,
and on its crest a glittering <i>clach-bhuai</i>, or
stone of power, one of the three now in the
Scottish regalia.
</p>

<p>
Dissembling her hate, she entertained the
king very splendidly, and after dinner
conducted him out to view the beauties of the
place and the structure of her castle; and
Kenneth, pleased with her beauty (which her
raiment enhanced), for she wore a dress of
blue silk, without sleeves, a mantle of fine
linen, fastened by a brooch of silver, and all
her golden hair floating on her shoulders,
accompanied her into a tower, where, in an
upper apartment, and amid rich festooned
arras and 'curious sculptures' stood the
infernal machine.
</p>

<p>
She courteously and smilingly requested
the king to take the golden apple from the
right hand of the statue; and he, amazed by
the strange conceit, did so; on this a rushing
sound was heard within it as a string or cord
gave way, and from its mouth there came
forth two barbed arrows which mortally
wounded him, and he fell at her feet.
</p>

<p>
Finella fled to Den Finella, and Kenneth
was found by his retinue '<i>bullerand in his
blude</i>.'
</p>

<p>
Den Finella, says a writer, is said, in the
genuine spirit of legendary lore, to have
obtained its name from this princess, who,
the more readily to evade her pursuers,
stepped from the branches of one tree to
those of another the whole way from her
castle to this den, which is near the sea, in
the parish of St. Cyres, as all the country
then was a wild forest.
</p>

<p>
Buchanan deems all this story a fable,
though asserted by John Major and Hector
Boece, and thinks it more probable that the
king was slain near Fettercairn in an ambush
prepared by Finella.
</p>

<p>
So ended the legend.
</p>

<p>
As the girl read on, Vivian Hammersley
had bent lower and lower over her, till the
tip of his moustache nearly touched her rich
dark hair, and his arm all but stole round
her.  Finella Melfort was quite conscious of
this close proximity, and though she did not
shrink from it, that consciousness made her
colour deepen and her sweet voice become unsteady.
</p>

<p>
'That is the story of Finella of Fettercairn,'
said she, closing the book.
</p>

<p>
'And to this awful legend of the dark
ages, which only wants blue-fire, lime-light,
and a musical accompaniment to set it off,
you owe your name?' said he, laughingly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes&mdash;it was grandfather's whim.'
</p>

<p>
'It is odd that you&mdash;the belle of the last
London season, should be named after such a
grotesque old termagant!'
</p>

<p>
She looked up at him smilingly, and then,
as their eyes met, the expression of that
glance exchanged beside the well on the hills
came into them again; heart spoke to heart;
he bent his face nearer hers, and his arm
went round her in earnest.
</p>

<p>
'Finella, my darling!' escaped him, and as
he kissed her unresisting lips, her blushing
face was hidden on his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
And <i>this</i> tableau was the result of the two
days' shooting&mdash;a sudden result which neither
Shafto nor Hammersley had quite foreseen.
</p>

<p>
Of how long they remained thus neither
had any idea.  Time seemed to stand still
with them.  Finella was only conscious of
his hand caressing hers, which lay so willingly
in his tender, yet firm, clasp.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley in the gush of his joy felt
oblivious of all the world.  He could think
of nothing but Finella, while the latter
seemed scarcely capable of reflection at all
beyond the existing thought that he loved
her, and though the avowal was a silent and
unuttered one, the new sense of all it admitted
and involved, seemed to overwhelm the girl;
her brightest day-dreams had come, and she
nestled, trembling and silent, by his side.
</p>

<p>
The unwelcome sound of voices and also
of carriage-wheels on the terrace roused
them.  He released her hand, stole one
more clinging kiss, and forgetful of his fall
and all about it started with impatience to
his feet.
</p>

<p>
Lady Fettercairn and her lady guests had
returned from the flower-show, and to avoid
them and all the world, for a little time yet,
the lovers, with their hearts still beating too
wildly to come down to commonplace, tacitly
wandered hand in hand into the recesses of a
conservatory, and lingered there amid the
warm, flower-scented atmosphere and shaded
aisles, in what seemed a delicious dream.
</p>

<p>
Finella was conscious that Vivian
Hammersley was talking to her lovingly and
caressingly, in a low and tender voice as he
had never talked before, and she felt that
she was 'Finella'&mdash;the dearest and sweetest
name in the world to him&mdash;and no more
Miss Melfort.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * *
</p>

<p>
It would be difficult, and superfluous
perhaps, to describe the emotions of these
two during the next few days.
</p>

<p>
Though now quite aware that Finella and
Hammersley had met each other frequently
before, Shafto's surprise at their intimacy,
though apparently undemonstrative, grew
speedily into suspicious anger.  He felt
intuitively that <i>his</i> presence made not the
slightest difference to them, though he did
not forget it; and he failed to understand
how 'this fellow' had so quickly
gained his subtle and familiar position with
Finella.'
</p>

<p>
It galled him to the quick to see and feel
all this, and know that he could never please
her as she seemed to be pleased with
Hammersley; for her colour heightened, her eyes
brightened, and her eyelashes drooped and
flickered whenever he approached or
addressed her.
</p>

<p>
Shafto thought of his hopes of gaining
Finella and her fortune against any discovery
that might be made of the falsehood of his
position, and so wrath and hatred gathered
in his heart together.
</p>

<p>
He was baffled at times by her bright
smiles and pretty, irresistible manner, but
nevertheless he 'put his brains in steep' to
scheme again.

CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
AT REVELSTOKE AGAIN.
</h3>

<p>
Meanwhile sore trouble had come upon
Dulcie Carlyon in her Devonshire home.
</p>

<p>
Her father had been dull and gloomy of
late, and had more than once laid his hand
affectionately on her ruddy golden hair, and
said in a prayerful way that 'he hoped he
might soon see her well married, and that she
might never be left friendless!'
</p>

<p>
'Why such thoughts, dear papa?' she would
reply.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had felt a sense of apprehension for
some time past.  Was it born of her father's
forebodings, or of the presentiment about
which she had conversed with Florian?  A
depression hung over her&mdash;an undefinable
dread of some great calamity about to happen.
At night her sleep was restless and broken,
and by day a vague fear haunted her.
</p>

<p>
The evil boded was to happen soon now.
</p>

<p>
With these oppressive thoughts mingled
the memory of the tall and handsome dark-eyed
lad she loved&mdash;it seemed so long ago,
and she longed to hear his voice again, and
for his breast to lay her head upon.  But
where was Florian now?  Months had passed
without her hearing of him, and she might
never hear again!
</p>

<p>
Little could she have conceived the foul
trick that Shafto had played them both in the
matter of the locket; but, unfortunately for
herself, she had not seen the last of that
enterprising young gentleman.
</p>

<p>
She felt miserably that her heart was lonely
and heavy, and that, young as she was, light
and joy, with the absence and ruin of Florian,
had gone out of her life.  She was alone
always with her great sorrow, and longed
much for tears; but as her past life had been
a happy and joyous one, Dulcie Carlyon had
been little&mdash;if at all&mdash;given to them.
</p>

<p>
One morning her father did not appear at
breakfast as usual.  As yet undressed her
red-golden hair, that the old man loved to stroke
and caress, was floating in a great loose mass
on her back and shoulders, and her blue eyes
looked bright and clear, if thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
She had, as was her daily wont, arranged
his letters, cut and aired the morning papers
for him, adjusted a vase of fresh flowers on
the table, with a basket of delicate peaches,
which she knew he liked, from the famous
south wall of the garden, with green fig
leaves round them, for Dulcie did everything
prettily and tastefully, however trivial.  Then
she cut and buttered his bread, poured out his
tea, and waited.
</p>

<p>
Still he did not appear.  She knocked on
his bedroom door, but received no answer,
and saw, with surprise, that his boots were
still on the mat outside.
</p>

<p>
She peeped in and called on him&mdash;'Papa,
papa!' but there was no response.
</p>

<p>
The room was empty, and the morning sun
streamed through the uncurtained window.
The bed had not been slept in!  Again she
called his name, and rushed downstairs in
alarm and affright.
</p>

<p>
The gas was burning in his writing-room;
the window was still closed as it had been
overnight; and there, in his easy chair, with
his hands and arms stretched out on the table,
sat Llewellen Carlyon, with his head bent
forward, asleep as Dulcie thought when she saw him.
</p>

<p>
'Poor papa,' she murmured; 'he has actually
gone to sleep over his horrid weary work.'
</p>

<p>
She leaned over his chair; wound her soft
arms round his neck and bowed grey head&mdash;her
lovely blue eyes melting with tenderness,
her sweet face radiant with filial love, till, as
she laid her cheek upon it, a mortal chill
struck her, and a low cry of awful dismay escaped her.
</p>

<p>
'What is this&mdash;papa?'
</p>

<p>
She failed to rouse him, for his sleep was
the sleep of death!
</p>

<p>
It was disease of the heart, the doctors
said, and he had thus passed away&mdash;died in
harness; a pen was yet clutched in his right
hand, and an unfinished legal document lay beneath it.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie fainted, and was borne away by the
servants to her own room&mdash;they were old and
affectionate country folks, who had been long
with Llewellen Carlyon, and loved him and
his daughter well.
</p>

<p>
Poor Dulcie remained long unconscious,
the sudden shock was so dreadful to her, and
when she woke from it, the old curate,
Mr. Pentreath, who had baptized Florian and
herself, was standing near her bed.
</p>

<p>
'My poor bruised lamb,' said he, kindly
and tenderly, as he passed his wrinkled hand
over her rich and now dishevelled tresses.
</p>

<p>
'What has happened?' she asked wildly.
</p>

<p>
'You fainted, Dulcie.'
</p>

<p>
'Why&mdash;I never fainted before.'
</p>

<p>
'She don't seem to remember, sir,' whispered
an old servant, who saw the vague and
wild inquiring expression of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'Drink this, child, and try to eat a morsel,'
said the curate, putting a cup of coffee and
piece of toast before her.
</p>

<p>
'Something happened&mdash;something
dreadful&mdash;what was it&mdash;oh, what was it?' asked
Dulcie, putting her hands to her throbbing temples.
</p>

<p>
'Drink, dear,' said the curate again.
</p>

<p>
She drank of the coffee thirstily; but
declined the bread.
</p>

<p>
'I beat up an egg in the coffee,' said he;
'I feared you might be unable to eat yet.'
</p>

<p>
Her blue eyes began to lose their wandering
and troubled look, and to become less
wild and wistful; then suddenly a shrill cry
escaped her, and she said, with a calmness
more terrible and painful than fainting or hysterics:
</p>

<p>
'Oh, I remember now&mdash;papa&mdash;poor papa&mdash;dead!
Found dead!  Oh, my God! help
me to bear it, or take me too&mdash;take me too!'
</p>

<p>
'Do not speak thus, child,' said Mr. Pentreath gently.
</p>

<p>
'How long ago was it&mdash;yesterday&mdash;a
month ago, or when?  I seem&mdash;I feel as if
I had grown quite old, yet you all look just
the same&mdash;just the same; how is this?'
</p>

<p>
'My child,' said the curate, with dim eyes,
'your dire calamity happened but a short time
ago&mdash;little more than an hour since.'
</p>

<p>
Her response was a deep and heavy sob,
that seemed to come from her overcharged
heart rather than her slender throat, and
which was the result of the unnatural tension
of her mind.
</p>

<p>
'Come to my house with me,' said the
kind old curate; but Dulcie shook her head.
</p>

<p>
'I cannot leave papa, dead or alive.  I
wish to be with him, and alone.'
</p>

<p>
'I shall not leave you so; it is a mistake
in grief to avoid contact with the world.
The mind only gets sadder and deeper into
its gloom of melancholy.  If you could but
sleep, child, a little.'
</p>

<p>
'Sleep&mdash;I feel as if I had been asleep for
years; and it was this morning, you tell
me&mdash;only this morning I had my arms round
his neck&mdash;dead&mdash;my darling papa dead!'
</p>

<p>
She started to her feet as if to go where
the body lay under the now useless hands of
the doctor, but would have fallen had she not
clutched for support at Mr. Pentreath, who
upheld and restrained her.
</p>

<p>
The awful thought of her future loneliness
now that she had thus suddenly lost her
father, as she had not another relation in the
world, haunted the unhappy Dulcie, and
deprived her of the power of taking food or
obtaining sleep.
</p>

<p>
In vain her old servants, who had known
her from infancy, coaxed her to attempt
both, but sleep would not come, and the food
remained untasted before her.
</p>

<p>
'A little water,' she would say; 'give me
a little water, for thirst parches me.'
</p>

<p>
All that passed subsequently seemed like
one long and terrible dream to Dulcie.  She
was alone in the world, and when her father
was laid in his last home at Revelstoke, within
sound of the tumbling waves, in addition to
being alone she found herself well-nigh penniless,
for her father had nothing to leave her
but the old furniture of the house they had
inhabited.
</p>

<p>
That was sold, and she was to remain with
the family of the curate till some situation
could be procured for her.
</p>

<p>
She had long since ceased to expect any
letter from or tidings of Florian.  She began
to think that perhaps, amid the splendour of
his new relations, he had forgotten her.  Well,
it was the way of the world.
</p>

<p>
Never would she forget the day she quitted
her old home.  Her father's hat, his coat and
cane were in the hall; all that he had used and
that belonged to him were still there, to bring
his presence before her with fresh poignancy,
and to impress upon her that she was fatherless,
all but friendless, and an orphan.
</p>

<p>
The superstitious people about Revelstoke
now remembered that in Lawyer Carlyon's
garden, blossom and fruit had at the same time
appeared on more than one of his apple-trees,
a certain sign of coming death to one of his
household.  But who can tell in this
ever-shifting world what a day may bring forth!
</p>

<p>
One evening&mdash;she never forgot it&mdash;she had
been visiting her father's grave, and was
slowly quitting the secluded burial-ground,
when a man like a soldier approached her
in haste.
</p>

<p>
'Florian!'  She attempted to utter his
name, but it died away on her bloodless lips.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
''TIS BUT THE OLD, OLD STORY.'
</h3>

<p>
A poet says:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Not by appointment do we meet delight<br />
  And joy: they need not our expectancy.<br />
  But round some corner in the streets of life,<br />
  They on a sudden clasp us with a smile.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Florian it was who stood before her, but
though he gazed at her earnestly, wistfully,
and with great pity in his tender eyes as he
surveyed her pale face and deep mourning,
he made no attempt to take the hands she
yearningly extended towards him.  She saw
that he was in the uniform of a private soldier,
over which he wore a light dust-coat as a sort
of disguise, but there was no mistaking his
glengarry&mdash;that head-dress which is odious
and absurd for English and Irish regiments,
and which in his instance bore a brass
badge&mdash;the sphinx, for Egypt.
</p>

<p>
He looked thin, gaunt, and pale, and anon
the expression of his eye grew doubtful and
cloudy.
</p>

<p>
'Florian!' exclaimed Dulcie in a piercing
voice, in which something of upbraiding
blended with tones of surprise and grief; and
yet the fact of his presence seemed so unreal
that she lingered for a moment before she
flung herself into his arms, and was clasped
to his breast.  'Oh, what is the meaning of
this dress?' she asked, lifting her face and
surveying him again.
</p>

<p>
'It means that I am a soldier&mdash;like him
whose son I thought myself&mdash;a soldier of the
Warwickshire Regiment,' replied Florian with
some bitterness of tone.
</p>

<p>
'Oh, my God, and has it come to this!'
said Dulcie wringing her interlaced fingers.
'Could not Shafto&mdash;your cousin&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Shafto cast me off&mdash;seemed as if he could
not get rid of me too soon.'
</p>

<p>
'How cruel, when he might have done so
much for you, to use you so!'
</p>

<p>
'I had no other resort, Dulcie; I would
not stoop to seek favours even from him, and
our paths in life will never cross each other
again; but a time may come&mdash;I know not
when&mdash;in which I may seek forgiveness of
enemies as well as friends&mdash;the bad and the
good together&mdash;for a soldier's life is one of
peril.'
</p>

<p>
'Of horror&mdash;to me!' wailed Dulcie, weeping
freely on his breast.
</p>

<p>
'This tenderness is strange, Dulcie!  Why
did you cast me off in my utter adversity and
return to me my locket?'
</p>

<p>
Dulcie looked up in astonishment.
</p>

<p>
'What <i>do</i> you mean, Florian&mdash;have you
lost your senses?' she asked in sore perplexity.
'Where have you come from last?'
</p>

<p>
'Plymouth; in a paper there I saw a notice
of your terrible loss, and resolved to see, even
if I could not speak with you.'
</p>

<p>
'And you came&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'To see you, my lost darling, once again.
Oh, Dulcie, I thought I should die if I left
England and sailed for Africa without doing
so.  I got a day's leave and am here.'
</p>

<p>
'But why have you done this?'
</p>

<p>
'This&mdash;what?'
</p>

<p>
'Soldiering!'
</p>

<p>
'Penniless, hopeless, what else could I
do?&mdash;besides, I thought you had cast me off
when you sent me back this locket,' he added,
producing the gift referred to.
</p>

<p>
'That locket was stolen from me on the
night you left Revelstoke&mdash;literally wrenched
from my neck, as I told you in my letter&mdash;the
letter you never answered.'
</p>

<p>
'I received no letter, Dulcie&mdash;but your
locket was taken from you by whom?'
</p>

<p>
'Shafto.'
</p>

<p>
'The double villain!  He must have intercepted
that letter, and utilised the envelope
with its postmarks and stamps to deceive me,
and effect a breach between us.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank God you came, dearest Florian!'
</p>

<p>
'I thought you had renounced me, Dulcie,
and now I almost wish you had.'
</p>

<p>
'Why?'
</p>

<p>
'It is little use to remember me now&mdash;I
am so poor and hopeless.'
</p>

<p>
'After all,' said she, taking his face between
her hands caressingly, 'what does poverty
matter if we love each other still?'
</p>

<p>
'And you love me, Dulcie&mdash;love me yet!'
exclaimed Florian passionately.
</p>

<p>
'And shall never, never cease to do so.'
</p>

<p>
'But I am so much beneath you now in
position, Dulcie&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;' his voice
broke.
</p>

<p>
'What, darling?'
</p>

<p>
'May never rise.'
</p>

<p>
'Would I be a true woman if I forsook you
because you were unfortunate?'
</p>

<p>
'No; but you are more than a woman,
Dulcie&mdash;you are a golden-haired angel!'
</p>

<p>
'My poor Florian, how gaunt and hollow
your cheeks are!  You have suffered&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Much since last we parted here in dear
old Devonshire.  But Shafto's villainy
surpasses all I could have imagined!'
</p>

<p>
'And where is Shafto now?'
</p>

<p>
'With his grand relations, I suppose.  I
am glad that we have unravelled that which
was to me a source of sorrow and dismay&mdash;the
returned locket.  So you cannot take
back your heart, Dulcie, nor give me mine?'
said Florian.
</p>

<p>
'Nor would I wish to do so,' she replied,
sweetly and simply.  'Though poor, we are
all the world to each other now.'
</p>

<p>
'Hard and matter-of-fact as our every-day
existence is, there is&mdash;even in these
railway times&mdash;much of strange and painful
romance woven up with many a life; and
so it seems to be with mine&mdash;with ours,
Dulcie.'
</p>

<p>
'Oh that I were rich, Florian, or that you
were so!' exclaimed the girl, as a great pity
filled her heart, when she thought of her
lover's blighted life, their own baffled hopes,
and the humble and most perilous course that
was before him in South Africa, where the
clouds of war were gathering fast.  'I, too,
am poor, Florian&mdash;very poor; dear papa died
involved, leaving me penniless, and I must
cast about to earn my own bread.'
</p>

<p>
'This is horrible&mdash;how shall I endure it?'
said he fiercely, while regarding her with a
loving but haggard expression in his dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
'What would you have done if you had not
met me by chance here?'
</p>

<p>
'Loafed about till the last moment, and
then done something desperate.  I <i>would</i> have
seen you, and after that&mdash;the Deluge!  In
two days we embark at Plymouth,' he added,
casting a glance at the old church of
Revelstoke and its burying-ground.  'There our
parents lie, Dulcie&mdash;yours at least, and those
that I, till lately, thought were mine.  There
is something very strange and mysterious in
this change of relationship and position
between Shafto and myself.  I cannot understand
it.  Why was I misled all my life by
one who loved me so well?  How often have
I stood with the Major by a gravestone
yonder inscribed with the name of Flora
MacIan and heard him repeat while looking
at it&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'A thousand would call the spot dreary<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where thou takest thy long repose;<br />
  But a rude couch is sweet to the weary,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the frame that suffering knows.<br />
  I never rejoiced more sincerely<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Than at thy funeral hour,<br />
  Assured that the one I loved dearly<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was beyond affliction's power!<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Why did he quote all this to me, and tell
me never to forget that spot, or who was
buried there, if she was only Shafto's aunt,
and not my mother?'
</p>

<p>
Florian felt keenly for the position of
Dulcie Carlyon, and the perils and mortifications
that might beset her path now; but
he was too young, too healthy and full of
animal life and spirits, to be altogether
weighed down by the thought of his humble
position and all that was before him; and
now that he had seen her again, restored to
her bosom the locket, and that he knew she
was true to him, and had never for a moment
wavered in her girlish love, life seemed to
become suddenly full of new impulses and
hopes for him, and he thought prayerfully
that all might yet be well for them both.
</p>

<p>
But when?
</p>

<p>
To Dulcie there seemed something noble
in the hopeful spirit that, under her influence,
animated her grave lover now.  He seemed
to become calm, cool, steadfast, and, hap
what might, she felt he would ever be true
to her.
</p>

<p>
He seemed brave and tender and true&mdash;'tender
and true' as a Douglas of old, and
Dulcie thought how pleasant and glorious it
would be to have such a handsome young husband
as he to take care of her always, and see
that all she did was right and proper and wise.
</p>

<p>
A long embrace, and he was gone to catch
the inexorable train.  She was again alone,
and for the first time she perceived that the
sun had set, that the waves looked black as
they rounded Revelstoke promontory, and
that all the landscape had grown dark,
desolate, and dreary.
</p>

<p>
What a hopeless future seemed to stretch
before these two creatures, so young and so
loving!
</p>

<p>
Florian was gone&mdash;gone to serve as a
private soldier on the burning coast of Africa.
It seemed all too terrible, too dreadful to
think of.
</p>

<p>
'Every morning and evening I shall pray
for you, Florian,' wailed the girl in her heart;
'pray that you may be happy, good, and
rich, and&mdash;and that we shall yet meet in
heaven if we never meet on earth.'
</p>

<p>
On the second morning after this separation,
when Dulcie was pillowed in sleep, and
the rising sun was shining brightly on the
waves that rolled in Cawsand Bay and
danced over the Mewstone, a great white
'trooper' came out of Plymouth Sound under
sail and steam, with the blue-peter flying at
its foremasthead, her starboard side crowded
with red coats, all waving their caps and
taking a farewell look at Old England&mdash;the
last look it proved to many&mdash;and, led by Bob
Edgehill, a joyous, rackety, young private of
the Warwickshire, hundreds of voices joined
chorusing:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Merrily, my lads, so ho!<br />
  They may talk of a life at sea,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But a life on the land<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sword in hand<br />
  Is the life, my lads, for me!'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
But there was one young soldier whose
voice failed him in the chorus, and whose
eyes rested on Stoke Point and the mouth of
the Yealm till these and other familiar features
of the coast melted into the widening
Channel.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie was roused to exertion from the
stupor of grief that had come upon her by
tidings that a situation had been found for
her as companion&mdash;one in which she would
have to make herself useful, amiable, and
agreeable in the family of a lady of rank and
wealth, to whom she would be sent by
influential friends of Mr. Pentreath in London.
</p>

<p>
The poor girl thought tearfully how desolate
was her lot now, cast to seek her bread
among utter strangers; and if she became ill,
delicate, or unable to work, what would become
of her?
</p>

<p>
Her separation from Florian seemed now
greater than ever; but, as Heine has it:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Tis but the old, old story,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet it ever abideth new;<br />
  And to whomsoever it cometh<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The heart it breaks in two.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
To leave Revelstoke seemed another wrench.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie had been born and bred there,
and all the villagers in Revelstoke loved
and knew Lawyer Carlyon well, and were
deeply interested in the future of his daughter;
thus, on the day of her departure no one
made any pretence of work or working.
Heads were popping out and in of the windows
of the village street all morning, and a
cluster&mdash;a veritable crowd&mdash;of kindly folks
accompanied Mr. Pentreath and the weeping
girl to the railway station, for she wept freely
at all this display of regard and sympathy,
especially from the old, whom she might
never see again.
</p>

<p>
When the train swept her away, and she
lost sight of the last familiar feature of her
native place, a strange and heavy sense of
utter desolation came over poor Dulcie, and
but for the presence of other passengers she
would have stooped her head upon her hot
hands and sobbed aloud, for she thought of
her dead parents&mdash;when did she not think of
them now?
</p>

<p>
'Oh!' exclaims a writer, 'if those who have
loved and gone before us can see afar off
those they have left, surely the mother who
had passed from earth might tremble now
for her child, standing so terribly alone in the
midst of a seething sea of danger and temptations?'

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
AT CRAIGENGOWAN.
</h3>

<p>
With the new understanding&mdash;the tacit
engagement that existed between herself and
Vivian Hammersley&mdash;Finella writhed with
annoyance when privately and pointedly
spoken to on the subject of her 'cousin'
Shafto's attentions and hopes.
</p>

<p>
'Grandmamma,' said she to Lady Fettercairn,
'I don't see why I may not marry
whom I please.  I am not like a poor girl
who has nothing in the world.  Indeed, in
that case I am pretty sure that neither you
nor cousin Shafto would want me.'
</p>

<p>
'She must settle soon,' said Lady Fettercairn,
when reporting this plain reply to
Lady Drumshoddy.  'I certainly shall not
take her to London again, yet awhile.'
</p>

<p>
'You are right,' replied that somewhat
grim matron; 'and when once this Captain
Hammersley, who, to my idea, is somewhat
too <i>èpris</i> with her, is gone, you can easily
find some pretext for remaining at Craigengowan;
or shall I have her with me?'
</p>

<p>
'As you please,' replied Lady Fettercairn,
who knew that the Drumshoddy <i>mènage</i> did
not always suit the taste of Finella; 'but I
think she is better here&mdash;propinquity and all
that sort of thing may be productive of good.
I know that poor Shafto's mind is quite made
up, and, as I said before, she must settle
soon.  We can't have twenty thousand a year
slipping out of the family.'
</p>

<p>
Finella thought little of their wishes or
those of Shafto.  She thought only of that
passionate hour in the lonely drawing-room,
where she was alone with Vivian, and his lips
were pressed to hers; of the close throb of
heart to heart, and that the great secret of
her young girl's life was his now and hers no
longer, but aware of the opposition and
antagonism he would be sure to encounter just
then, she urged upon him a caution and a
secrecy of the engagement which his proud
spirit somewhat resented.
</p>

<p>
He thought it scarcely honourable to take
advantage of Lord Fettercairn's hospitality,
and gain the love of Finella without his
permission; but as both knew that would
never be accorded&mdash;that to ask for it would
cut short his visit, and as he was so soon
going on distant service, with Finella he
agreed that their engagement should be kept
a secret till his return.
</p>

<p>
And to blind the eyes of the watchful or
suspicious he actually found himself flirting
with one of the Miss Kippilaws, three young
ladies who thought they spoke the purest
English, though it was with that accent which
Basil Hall calls 'the hideous patois of
Edinburgh;' and, perceiving this, Lady
Fettercairn became somewhat contented, and
Finella was excessively amused.
</p>

<p>
Not so the astute Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'It is all a d&mdash;&mdash;d game!' muttered that
young gentleman; 'a red herring drawn
across the scent.'
</p>

<p>
'Why do you look so unhappy, dearest?'
asked Finella one evening, when she and her
lover found themselves alone for a few
minutes, during which she had been
contemplating his dark face in silence.
</p>

<p>
'My leave of absence is running out so
fast&mdash;by Jove, faster than ever apparently
now!'
</p>

<p>
'Is that the sole reason?' asked the girl
softly and after a pause, her dark eyes
darkening and seeming to become more
intense.
</p>

<p>
'No,' he replied, with hesitation.
</p>

<p>
'Tell me, then&mdash;what is the other?'
</p>

<p>
'You know how I love you&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'And I&mdash;you.'
</p>

<p>
'But in one sense my love is so liable to
misconstruction&mdash;so hopeless of proof.'
</p>

<p>
'Hopeless, Vivian&mdash;after all I have
admitted?' she asked reproachfully.
</p>

<p>
'I mean because I am almost penniless as
compared to you.'
</p>

<p>
'What does that matter?  Surely I have
enough for two,' said she, laughing.
</p>

<p>
'And I fear the bitter opposition of your
family.'
</p>

<p>
'So do I; but don't mind it,' said the
independent little beauty.
</p>

<p>
'I have heard a rumour that one of the
Melforts who made a pure love-marriage was
cut off root and branch.'
</p>

<p>
'That was poor Uncle Lennard, before I
was born.  Well&mdash;they can't cut <i>me</i> off.'
</p>

<p>
'They will never consent; and when I am
far away, as I soon shall be, if their evil
influence&mdash;&mdash;'
</p>

<p>
'Should prevail with me?  Oh, Vivian!'
exclaimed the girl, her dark eyes sparkling
through their unshed tears.  'Think not of
their influencing me, for a moment.'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you a thousand times for the
assurance, my love.  It was vile of me to
think of such things.  I have a sure conviction
that your cousin Shafto dislikes me most
certainly,' said Hammersley, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
'I don't doubt it,' said she.
</p>

<p>
'They mean you for him.'
</p>

<p>
'They&mdash;who?'
</p>

<p>
'Your grandparents.'
</p>

<p>
'I know they do&mdash;but don't tease me by
speaking of a subject so distasteful,' exclaimed
Finella, making a pretty moue expression of
disdain.
</p>

<p>
He pressed a kiss on her brow, another on
her hair, and his lips quickly found their way
to hers, after they had been pressed on her
snow-white eyelids.
</p>

<p>
'I love you with my whole heart, Finella,'
he exclaimed passionately.
</p>

<p>
'And I you,' said the artless girl again, in
that style of iteration of which lovers never
grow weary, with an adoring upward glance,
which it was a pity the gathering gloom
prevented him from seeing.
</p>

<p>
As they walked slowly towards the house,
she quickly withdrew her hands, which were
clasped clingingly to his arm, as Shafto
approached them suddenly.  He saw the abrupt
act, and drew his own conclusions therefrom,
and, somewhat to Finella's annoyance, turned
abruptly away.
</p>

<p>
'So that is the amiable youth for whom
they design you,' said he in a whisper.
</p>

<p>
'Did I not say you were not to speak of
him?  To tell you the truth, I am at times
somewhat afraid of him.'
</p>

<p>
'My darling&mdash;I must give you an amulet&mdash;a
charm against his evil influence,' said
Hammersley, laughing, as he slipped a ring
on her wedding-finger, adding, 'I hope it fits.'
</p>

<p>
'What is this&mdash;oh, Vivian! actually a
wedding-ring&mdash;but I cannot wear, though I
may keep it.'
</p>

<p>
'Then wear this until you can, when I
return, darling,' said he, as he slipped a
gemmed ring on the tiny finger, and
stooping, kissed it.
</p>

<p>
'My heart's dearest!' cooed the girl
happily.  'Well, Vivian, none other than the
hoop you have now given me shall be my
wedding-ring!'
</p>

<p>
Had Lady Fettercairn overheard all this
she would have had good reason to fear that
Finella's twenty thousand a year was slipping
away from the Craigengowan family, all the
more so that the scene of this tender
interview was a spot below the mansion-house,
said to be traditionally fatal to the Melforts
of Fettercairn, the Howe of Craigengowan&mdash;for
there a terrible adventure occurred to the
first Lord, he who sold his Union vote, and of
whom the men of the Mearns were wont to
say he had not only sold his country to her
enemies, but that he had also sold his soul to
the evil one.
</p>

<p>
It chanced that in the gloaming of the
28th of April, 1708, the first anniversary of
that day on which the Scottish Parliament
dissolved to meet no more, he was walking
in a place which he had bought with his
Union bribe&mdash;the Howe of Craigengowan,
then a secluded dell, overshadowed by great
alders and whin bushes&mdash;when he saw at the
opposite end the figure of a man approaching
pace for pace with himself, and his outline
was distinctly seen against the red flush of
the western sky.
</p>

<p>
As they neared each other slowly, a strange
emotion of superstitious awe stole into the
hard heart of Lord Fettercairn.  So strong
was this that he paused for a minute, and
rested on his cane.  The stranger did
precisely the same.
</p>

<p>
The peer&mdash;the ex-Commissioner on Forfeited
Estates&mdash;'pulled himself together,'
and put his left hand jauntily into the silver
hilt of his sword&mdash;a motion imitated exactly,
and to all appearance mockingly, by the
other, whose gait, bearing, and costume&mdash;a
square-skirted crimson coat, a long-flapped
white vest, black breeches and stockings
rolled over the knee, and a Ramillie wig&mdash;were
all the same in cut and colour as his
own!
</p>

<p>
Lord Fettercairn afterwards used to assert
that he would never be able to describe the
undefinable, the strange and awful sensation
that crept over him when, as they neared
each other, pace by pace, he saw in the
other's visage the features of himself
reproduced, as if he had been looking into a
mirror.
</p>

<p>
A cold horror ran through every vein.
He knew and felt that his own features were
pallid and convulsed with mortal terror and
dismay, while he could see that those of his
dreadful counterpart were radiant with spite
and triumphant malice.
</p>

<p>
Himself seemed to look upon himself&mdash;the
same in face, figure, dress; every
detail was the same, save that the other
clutched a canvas bag, inscribed '£500'
the price of the Union vote (or, as some
said, the price of his soul)&mdash;on seeing which
my Lord Fettercairn shrieked in an agony
of terror, and fell prone on his face&mdash;a
fiendish yell and laugh from the other making
all the lonely Howe re-echo as he did so.
</p>

<p>
How long he lay there he knew not precisely;
but when he opened his eyes the pale
April moon was shining down the Howe,
producing weird and eerie shadows, the alder
and whin bushes looked black and gloomy,
and the window lights were shining redly in
the tall and sombre mass of Craigengowan,
the gables, turrets, and vanes of which stood
up against the starry sky.
</p>

<p>
He never quite recovered the shock, but
died some years after; and even now on
dark nights, when owls hoot, ravens croak,
toads crawl, and the clock at Craigengowan
strikes twelve, something strange&mdash;no one
can exactly say what&mdash;is to be seen in the
Howe, even within sound of the railway
engine.
</p>

<p>
But to resume our own story:
</p>

<p>
Though a day for parting&mdash;for a separation
involving distance, time, and no small
danger to one&mdash;was inexorably approaching,
Finella was very happy just then, with a
happiness she had never known before, and
with a completeness that made life&mdash;even to
her who had known London for a brilliant
season&mdash;seem radiant.  She had been joyous
like a beautiful bird, and content, too, before
the renewal and fuller development of her
intimacy with Vivian Hammersley; but she
was infinitely more joyous and content now.
''Twas but the old, old story' of a girl's love,
and in all her sentiments and all her hopes
for the future Vivian shared.
</p>

<p>
The beautiful dreams of a dual life had
been partly&mdash;if not fully&mdash;realised through
him, who seemed to her a perfect being, a
perfect hero: though he was only a smart
linesman, a handsome young fellow like a
thousand others, yet he possessed every
quality to render a girl happy.
</p>

<p>
Shafto felt that Hammersley had quite
'cut the ground from under his feet' with
Finella, as he phrased it; and hating him in
consequence, and being a master in cunning
and finesse, wonderfully so for his years, he
resolved to get 'the interloper's' visit to
Craigengowan cut short at all hazards, and
he was not long in putting his scheme in
operation.
</p>

<p>
The lovers thus were not quite unconscious
of being watched by eyes that were quickened
by avarice, passion, and jealousy; yet, withal,
they were very, very happy&mdash;in Elysium, in
fact.
</p>

<p>
Finding that Hammersley had suddenly
become averse to gambling, after a long day
among the grouse, Shafto strove hard to lure
him into play one evening in the smoke-room.
</p>

<p>
Hammersley declined, aware that Shafto
was remarkably sharp at cards, having become
somewhat efficient after years of almost
nightly play in the bar-room of the Torrington
Arms at Revelstoke.
</p>

<p>
Shafto's manner on this evening became
almost insulting, and he taunted him with
'taking deuced good care of such money as
he had.'
</p>

<p>
''Pon my soul, young fellow, do you know
that you are rather&mdash;well&mdash;ah&mdash;rude?' said
Hammersley, removing his cigar for a
moment and staring at the speaker.
</p>

<p>
'Sorry, but it's my way,' replied Shafto.
</p>

<p>
'Perhaps you had better make that your
way,' said Hammersley, his brown cheek
reddening as he indicated the room-door with
his cigar.  Then suddenly remembering that
he must preserve certain amenities, and as
guest&mdash;especially one circumstanced as he was
secretly&mdash;he pushed his cigar-case towards
Shafto, saying&mdash;'Try one of these&mdash;they are
Rio Hondos, and are of the best kind.'
</p>

<p>
'Thanks, I prefer my own,' said Shafto, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
At last, piqued by the manner of the latter,
and having been lured into drinking a little
more brandy and soda than was good for him
after dinner, the unsuspecting Englishman
sat down to play, and though he did so
carelessly, his success was wonderful, for, while
not caring to win, he won greatly.
</p>

<p>
Higher and higher rose the stakes, till a
very considerable sum had passed into his
hands, and, handsome though Shafto's
quarterly allowance from his 'grandfather,' paid
duly by Mr. Kippilaw, he could not help the
lengthening of his visage, and the growing
pallor of it, while his shifty eyes rolled about
in his anxiety and anger; and Lord Fettercairn
and young Kippilaw, who were present,
looked on&mdash;the former with some annoyance,
and the latter with amused interest.
</p>

<p>
Quite suddenly, Kippilaw exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
'Hey&mdash;what the deuce is this?  Captain
Hammersley, you have dropped a card.'
</p>

<p>
And he picked one up from that officer's
side, and laid it on the table.
</p>

<p>
'The ace of spades!  By heaven, you have
<i>already</i> played that card!' exclaimed Shafto,
with fierce triumph.
</p>

<p>
'It is not mine!' said Hammersley, hotly.
</p>

<p>
'Whose, then?'
</p>

<p>
'How the devil should I know?' asked
Hammersley, eyeing him firmly.
</p>

<p>
'Your luck has been marvellous, but not
so much so when we know that you play with
double aces,' said Shafto, throwing down his
cards and starting from the table, as the other
did, now pallid with just rage.
</p>

<p>
'Would you dare to insinuate?' began the
officer, in a hoarse tone.
</p>

<p>
'I insinuate nothing; but the disgraceful
fact speaks for itself; and I think you have
been quite long enough among us in
Craigengowan,' he added, coarsely.
</p>

<p>
Vivian Hammersley was pale as death,
and speechless with rage.  He thought first
of Finella and then of his own injured
honour; and we know not what turn this
episode might have taken had not Lord
Fettercairn, who, we have said, had been
quietly looking on from a corner, said gravely,
sharply, and even with pain, as he started
forward:
</p>

<p>
'Shafto!  I saw you drop <i>that card</i>, where
Mr. Kippilaw picked it up&mdash;drop it, whether
purposely or not I do not say&mdash;but drop it
you did.'
</p>

<p>
'Impossible, sir!'
</p>

<p>
'It is <i>not</i> impossible,' said the peer, irately;
'and I am not blind or liable to make
mistakes; and you too manifestly did so;
whence this foul accusation of a guest in
my own house&mdash;a gentleman to whom
you owe a humble and most complete
apology.'
</p>

<p>
Shafto was speechless with rage and baffled
spite at the new and sudden turn his scheme
had taken, and at being circumvented in his
own villainy.
</p>

<p>
'My Lord Fettercairn, from my soul I
thank you!' said Hammersley, drawing himself
up proudly, looking greatly relieved in
mind, and, turning next to Shafto, evidently
waited for the suggested apology.
</p>

<p>
But in that he was disappointed, as the
'heir' of Fettercairn turned abruptly on his
heel and left the room, leaving his lordship
to make the <i>amende</i>, which he did in very
graceful terms.
</p>

<p>
As it was impossible now for both to remain
longer under the same roof after a fracas of
this kind, Hammersley proposed at once to
take his departure for the south by a morning
train; but Lord Fettercairn, who, with all his
selfish shortcomings, had been shocked by the
episode, and by several other ugly matters
connected with his newly found 'grandson,'
would by no means permit of that
movement; and in this spirit of hospitality even
Lady Fettercairn joined, pressing him to
remain and finish his visit, as first intended,
while Shafto, in a gust of baffled rage and
resentment, greatly to the relief of Finella
and of the domestics, betook himself to
Edinburgh, thus for a time leaving his rival more
than ever in full possession of the field.
</p>

<p>
'Whether she is influenced by Captain
Hammersley I cannot say,' were the parting
words of Lady Fettercairn to this young
hopeful; 'but you seem by this last untoward
affair to have lost even her friendship, and it
will be a dreadful pity, Shafto, if all her
money should be lost to you too.'
</p>

<p>
And Shafto fully agreed with his 'dear
grandmother' that it would be a pity
indeed.
</p>

<p>
As a gentleman and man with a keen sense
of honour, Hammersley disliked exceedingly
the secrecy of the engagement he had made
with Finella, and felt himself actually colour
more than once when Lord Fettercairn
addressed him; but his compunctions about it
grew less when he thought of the awful
escape he had made from a perilous accusation,
that might have 'smashed' him in the
Service, and of the trickery of which Shafto
was capable&mdash;a trickery of which he had not
yet seen the end.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
AT THE BUFFALO RIVER.
</h3>

<p>
The evening of the 10th January was closing
in, and the blood-red African sun, through a
blended haze of gold and pale green, red and
fiery, seemed to linger like a monstrous
crimson globe at the horizon, tinging with
the same hues the Buffalo River as its broad
waters flowed past the Itelizi Hill towards
Rorke's Drift.
</p>

<p>
There a picquet of the Centre or Second
column of infantry (of the army then
advancing into Zululand), under Colonel Richard
Glyn of the 24th Regiment, was posted for
the night.  The main body of the picquet,
under Lieutenant Vincent Sheldrake, a smart
young officer, was bivouacked among some
mealies at a little distance from the bank of
the river, along the margin of which his
advanced sentinels were posted at proper
distances apart, and there each man stood
motionless as a statue, in his red tunic and
white tropical helmet, with his rifle at the
'order,' and his eyes steadily fixed on that
quarter in which the Zulu army was supposed
to be hovering.
</p>

<p>
To reach the Buffalo River the various
columns of Lord Chelmsford's army could
not march by regular roads, as no such thing
exists in Zululand, and the sole guides of our
officers in selecting the line of advance
through these savage regions were the
grass-covered ruts left by the waggon-wheels of
some occasional trader or sportsman in past
times.
</p>

<p>
As the column had been halted for the
night, at a considerable distance in rear of
the outlying picquet, the men of the latter
had their provisions with them ready cooked,
and were now having their supper in a grassy
donga or hollow.  The earthen floor was
their table, and Lieutenant Sheldrake, being
more luxurious than the rest, had spread
thereon as a cloth an old sheet of the <i>Times</i>;
but the appetites of all were good, and their
temperament cheery and hearty.  Their rifles
were piled, and they brewed their coffee over
a blazing fire, the flame of which glowed on
their sun-burned and beardless young faces,
and a few Kaffirs squatted round their own
fire, jabbered, gesticulated, and swallowed
great mouthfuls of their favourite liquor
'scoff.'
</p>

<p>
Sheldrake was too ill or weary to attend
closely to his own duties, and the moment
the evening meal was over, he desired the
sergeant of the picquet to 'go round the
advanced sentries.'
</p>

<p>
The sergeant, a young and slender man,
and who was no other than Florian, touched
the barrel of his rifle and departed on his
mission&mdash;to visit the sentinels in rotation by
the river bank, and see that they were in
communication with those of the picquets on
the right and left.
</p>

<p>
The scenery around was savage and
desolate; long feathery grass covered the
veldt for miles upon miles.  The chief features
in it were some blue gum trees, and on a
koppie, or little eminence, the deserted ruins
of a Boer farm under the shadow of a clump
of eucalyptus trees; and in the foreground
were some bustards and blue Kaffir cranes
by the river bank.
</p>

<p>
Short service and disease had given Florian
rapid promotion; for our soldiers, if brave,
had no longer the power of manly endurance
of their predecessors under the old system.
According to General Crealock, the extreme
youth of our soldiers in South Africa rendered
their powers for toil very small; while the
Naval Brigade, composed of older men, had
scarcely ever a man in hospital.  The Zulu
campaign was a very trying one; there were
the nightly entrenchments, the picquet duty
amid high grass, and the absence of all
confidence that discipline and that long mutual
knowledge of each other give in the ranks.
He added most emphatically that our younger
soldiers were unfit for European campaigning;
that half the First Division were 'sick;'
there were always some 200 weak lads in
hospital, 'crawling about like sick flies,' and,
like him, every officer was dead against the
short-service system.
</p>

<p>
The face of our young sergeant was handsome
as ever; but it was strangely altered
since late events had come to pass.  There
was a haggard and worn look in the features,
particularly in the eyes.  The latter looked
feverish and dim&mdash;their brightness less at
times, while a shadow seemed below them.
</p>

<p>
Florian having, as he now deemed, no
right to the name of Melfort, or even that of
MacIan, had enlisted under the latter name,
as that by which he had been known from
infancy, lest he might make a false
attestation.  The name of Gyle he shrank from,
even if it was his&mdash;which at times he doubted!
His regiment was the brave old 24th, or
Second Warwickshire, which had been raised
in the eventful year 1689 by Sir Edward
Dering, Bart, of Surrenden-Dering, head of
one of the few undoubted Saxon families in
England, and it was afterwards commanded
in 1695 by Louis, Marquis de Puizar.
</p>

<p>
Second to none in the annals of war during
the reigns of Anne and the early Georges,
the 24th in later times served with valour at
the first capture of the Cape of Good Hope,
in the old Egyptian campaign, in the wars of
Spain and India, and now they were once
again to cover themselves with a somewhat
clouded and desperate glory in conflict with
the gallant Zulus.
</p>

<p>
Florian in his new career found himself
occasionally among a somewhat mixed and
rough lot&mdash;the raw, weedy soldiers of the
new disastrous system&mdash;but there were many
who were of a better type; and the thought
of Dulcie Carlyon&mdash;the only friend he had in
the world, the only human creature who loved
him&mdash;kept him free from the temptations and
evil habits of the former; and he strove to
live a steady, pure, and brave life, that he
might yet be worthy of her, and give her no
cause to blush for him.
</p>

<p>
He got through his drilling as quickly as
he could, and soon discovered that the sooner
a soldier takes his place in the ranks the
better for himself.  He found that though
many of his comrades were noisy, talkative,
and quarrelsome, that the English soldier
quicker than any other discovers and appreciates
a gentleman.  His officers soon learned
to appreciate him too, and hence the rapidity
with which he won his three chevrons, and
Mr. Sheldrake felt that, young though he
was, he could trust Florian to go round the
sentinels.
</p>

<p>
Each was at his post, and the attention of
each increased as the gloom after sunset
deepened, for none knew who or what might
be approaching stealthily and unseen among
the long wavy grass and mossy dongas that
yawned amid the country in front.
</p>

<p>
'Hush, Bob!' said he to his comrade, Edgehill,
whom he heard singing merrily to himself,
'you should be mute as a fish on outpost
duty, and keep your ears open as well as your
eyes.  What have you got in your head,
Bob, that makes you so silly?  But, as the
author of the "Red Rag" says, we soldiers
have not much in our heads at any time, or
we wouldn't go trying to stop cannon balls
or bullets with them.'
</p>

<p>
'Right you are, Sergeant,' replied Bob,
'but I can't think what made you&mdash;a
gentleman&mdash;enlist.'
</p>

<p>
'Because I was bound to be a soldier, I
suppose.  And you?'
</p>

<p>
'Through one I wish I never had seen?'
</p>

<p>
'Who was that?'
</p>

<p class="poem">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'The handsome young girl,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With her fringe in curl,<br />
  That worked a sewing-machine,'<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
&mdash;sung the irrepressible Bob; and Florian
returned to report 'all right' to Mr. Sheldrake.
</p>

<p>
Though the actual cause of the Zulu war
lies a little apart from our story, it may be
necessary to mention that we invaded the
country of Cetewayo after giving him a
certain time, up to the 11th of January, to
accept our ultimatum; to adopt an alternative
for war, by delivering up certain of his subjects
who had violated British territory, attacked a
police-station, and committed many outrages,&mdash;among
others, carrying off two women, one
of whom they put to a barbarous death near
the Buffalo River.
</p>

<p>
But instead of making any apology, or
giving an indemnity, Cetewayo prepared to
defend himself at the head of an enormous
army of hardy Zulu warriors, all trained in a
fashion of their own, divided into strong
regiments, furnished with powerful shields
of ox-hide, and armed with rifles, war clubs,
and assegais&mdash;a name with which we are now
so familiar.  The shaft of this weapon averages
five feet in length, with the diameter of
an ordinary walking-stick, cut from the assegai
tree, which is not unlike mahogany in its fibre,
and furnished with a spear-head.  Some are
barbed, some double-barbed, and the tang of
the blade is fitted&mdash;when red-hot&mdash;into the
wood, not the latter into the blade, which is
then secured by a thong of wet hide, and
is so sharp that the Zulu can shave his
head with it; and it is a weapon which
they can launch with deadly and unerring
skill.
</p>

<p>
The Zulu king, says Captain Lucas, was
unable to sign his own name, 'and was as
ignorant and as savage as our Norman kings,'
and he thought no more of putting women,
'especially young girls, to death, than Bluff
King Hal' himself; yet a little time after all
this was to see him presented at Osborne,
and to become the petted and fêted exile of
Melbury Road, Kensington.
</p>

<p>
This night by the Buffalo River was
Florian's first experience of outpost duty,
and he felt&mdash;though not the responsible
party&mdash;anxious, wakeful, and weary after a
long and toilsome day's march.
</p>

<p>
He knew enough of military matters to be
well aware that the importance of outposts,
especially when dealing with a wily and savage
enemy, could scarcely be exaggerated, for no
force, when encamped in the field, can be
deemed for a moment safe without them.
Thus it was a maxim of Frederick the Great
that it was pardonable to be defeated, but
never to be surprised.
</p>

<p>
'I don't understand all this change that
has come over my life,' thought he, as he
stretched himself on the bare earth near the
picquet fire; 'but I wonder if my father and
mother can see and think of me where they
are.  Yet I sometimes feel,' he added, with
a kind of boyish gush in his heart, 'as if they
were near me and watching over me, so they
must see and think too.'
</p>

<p>
Where was Dulcie, then, and what was she
doing?  How supporting herself, as she said
she would have to do?  Had she found
friends, or, months ago, been trodden, with
all her tender beauty, down in the mire of
misfortune and adversity?
</p>

<p>
These were maddening thoughts for one
so far away and so utterly powerless to help
her as Florian felt himself, and rendered him
at times more reckless of his own existence
because it was useless to her.
</p>

<p>
The air around was heavy with the dewy
fragrance of strange and tropical plants, and
vast, spiky, and fan-shaped leaves cast their
shadows over him as he strove to snatch the
proverbial 'forty winks' before again going
'the rounds,' or posting the hourly reliefs, for
they are always hourly when before an enemy.
</p>

<p>
And when our weary young soldier did
sleep, he dreamt, not of the quick-coming
strife, nor even of blue-eyed Dulcie, with
her wealth of red golden hair, but, as the
tender smile on his lips might have showed,
of the time when his mother watched him in
his little cot, with idolizing gaze, and when he,
the now bronzed and moustached soldier, was
a little child, with rings of soft dusky hair
curling over his white forehead; when his
cheeks had a rosy flush, and his tiny mouth
a smile, and she fondly kissed the little hands
that lay outside the snow-white coverlet her
own deft fingers had made&mdash;the two wee
hands that held his mother's heart between
them&mdash;the heart that had long since mouldered
by Revelstoke Church.
</p>

<p>
And so he slept and dreamed till roused
by the inevitable cry of 'Sentry, go!' and,
that duty over, as he composed himself to
sleep again, with his knapsack under his
head for a pillow, he thought as a soldier&mdash;
</p>

CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
ELANDSBERGEN.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning when the picquet was relieved
young Sheldrake, who paid Hammersley's
company in absence of the latter, who was soon
expected with a strong draft from England,
said to Florian&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'Look here, MacIan, I've made a stupid
mistake.  The company's money I have left
among my heavier baggage in the fort beyond
Elandsbergen, and I have got the Colonel's
permission to send you back for it.  This
is just like me&mdash;I've a head, and so has a
pin!  The Quartermaster will lend you his
horse, and you can have my spare revolver
and ammunition.  Have a cigar before you
go,' he added, proffering his case, 'and look
sharp after yourself and the money.  There
is a deuced unchancy lot in the quarter you
are going back to.  We don't advance from
this till to-morrow, so you have plenty of
time to be with us ere we cross the river, if
you start at once.'
</p>

<p>
'Very good, sir,' replied Florian, as he
saluted and went away to obtain the horse,
the revolver, and to prepare for a duty which
he intensely disliked, and almost doubted his
power to carry out, as it took him rearward
through a country of which he was ignorant,
which was almost without roads, and where
he would be single-handed, if not among
savages, among those who were quite as
bad, for in some of these districts, as in the
Orange Free State and Boerland, there
swarmed broken ruffians of every kind,
many of them deserters; and, says an
officer, 'so great, in fact, was the number
of these undesirable specimens of our
countrymen assembled in Harrysmith alone
that night was truly made hideous with
their howlings, respectable persons were
afraid to leave their houses after nightfall,
and the report of revolvers ceased to elicit
surprise or curiosity.  I have been in some
of the most notorious camps and towns in
the territories and mining districts of the
United States, but can safely assert that I
never felt more thankful than when I found
my horse sufficiently rested here to continue
my journey.'  There were lions, too, in the
wild plains, for some of our cavalry horses
were devoured by them; the tiger-cat and
the aarde-wolf also.
</p>

<p>
With a knowledge of all this Florian
loaded his revolver, looked carefully to the
bridle and stirrup leathers of his horse,
received a note from Mr. Sheldrake to the
officer commanding the little fort near the
foot of the Drakensberg, and left the camp
of No. 2 column on his solitary journey,
steering his way by the natural features of
the country so far as he could recall them
after the advance of the 10th January, and
watching carefully for the wheel tracks or
other indications of a roadway leading in a
westerly direction; and many of his comrades,
including Bob Edgehill, watched him with
interest and kindly anxiety till his white
helmet disappeared as he descended into a
long grassy donga, about a mile from Rorke's
Drift.
</p>

<p>
The evening passed and the following day
dawned&mdash;the important 12th&mdash;when Zululand
was to be invaded at three points by the three
columns of Lord Chelmsford; the advance
party detailed from Colonel Glyn's brigade
to reconnoitre the ground in front got under
arms and began to move off, and Sheldrake
and others began to feel somewhat uneasy,
for there was still no appearance of the
absent one.
</p>

<p class="t3">
* * * *
</p>

<p>
The country through which Florian rode
was lonely, and farmhouses were few and
many miles apart.  Its natural features were
undulating downs covered with tall waving
grass, furrowed by deep, reedy water-courses;
here and there were abrupt rocky eminences,
and dense brushwood grew in the rugged
kloofs and ravines.
</p>

<p>
The air was delightful, and in spite of his
thoughts the blood coursed freely through
his veins; his spirits rose, and, exhilarated
by the pace at which his horse went, he could
not help giving a loud 'Whoop!' now and
then when a gnu, with its curved horns and
white mane, or a hartebeest appeared on the
upland slopes, or a baboon grinned at him
from amid the bushes of a kloof.
</p>

<p>
Before him stretched miles of open and
grassy veldt, and the flat-topped hills of the
Drakensberg range closed the horizon.  The
vast stretch of plain, across which ever and
anon swept herds of beautiful little antelopes,
was covered with luxuriant grass, which
seemed smooth as a billiard-table, and over it
went the track, which he was always afraid of
losing.  But, if pleasant to look upon, the
veldt was treacherous ground, for hidden by
the grass were everywhere deep holes
burrowed by the ant-bears, and into these his
horse's forelegs sank ever and anon, to the
peril of the animal and his rider too.  Thus
Florian was compelled to proceed at a canter
with his reins loose, while he sat tight and
prepared for swerving when his nag, which was a
native horse, prepared to dodge an apparent
hole, which they can do with wonderful sagacity.
</p>

<p>
So Florian was not sorry when he left the
veldt behind him, and after a ride of about
thirty miles saw the earthworks of the small
fort at the foot of Drakensberg appear in
front with a little Union Jack fluttering on a
flagstaff.
</p>

<p>
This was about mid-day.
</p>

<p>
Anxious to return as soon as he could rest
his horse, he lost no time in delivering
Sheldrake's note to the officer in command,
and with the key of a trunk indicated
therein among his best uniform, and amid
girls' photos, bundles of letters, old button
bouquets, rare pipes, and an omnium-gatherum
of various things, the bag was found,
with the company's money, and delivered to
Florian, who, after a two hours' halt, set out
on his return journey; but he had not
proceeded many miles when he found that his
horse was utterly failing him, and, regretting
that he had not remained at the post for the
night, he resolved to spend it in the little
town of Elandsbergen, towards which he bent
his way, leading the now halting nag by the
bridle.
</p>

<p>
Elandsbergen consisted of a few widely
detached cottages studding both sides of a
broad pathway, amid a vast expanse of veldt
or prairie, with fragmentary attempts at
cultivation here and there; and how the people
lived seemed somewhat of a mystery.  Rows
of stunted oaks lined the street, if such it
could be called, and through it flowed a rill of
pure water, at which the poor nag drank
thirstily.
</p>

<p>
Elandsbergen boasted of one hostelry,
dignified by the title of the Royal Hotel,
where 'civil entertainment for man and beast'
was promised by the landlord, 'Josh Jarrett.'  It
was a somewhat substantial edifice of two
storeys, built of baked brick, square in form,
with a flat roof composed of strong lattice-work,
covered with half-bricks and with clayey
mortar to render it impervious to the torrents
of the South African rainy season.
</p>

<p>
In some of the windows were glass panes;
in others sheepskin with the wool off, which,
in consequence of extreme tension, attains a
certain transparency.  Giving his horse to a
Kaffir ostler, whose sole raiment was a
waistcoat made of a sleeveless regimental tunic,
Florian somewhat wearily entered the 'hotel,'
the proprietor of which started and changed
colour at the sight of his red coat, as well he
might, for, though disguised by a bushy beard,
sedulously cultivated, and a shock head of
hair under his broad-leaved hat, he was one
of the many deserters from our troops,
already referred to, and, though apparently
anxious to appear civil, was secretly a ruffian
of the worst kind.
</p>

<p>
The room into which he ushered Florian
was bare-walled, the furniture was of the
plainest and rudest kind, and the floor was
formed of cow-dung over wet clay, all
kneaded, trodden, and hardened till it could
be polished, a process learned from the Zulus
in the construction of their kraals.
</p>

<p>
A fly-blown map of Cape Colony, a cheap
portrait of Sir Bartle Frere, and the skull of
an eland with its spiral horns were the only
decorations of the apartment, and the literature
of 'the day' was represented by three
tattered copies of the <i>Cape Argus</i>, <i>Natal
Mercury</i>, and the <i>Boer Volksteem</i>.
</p>

<p>
Josh Jarrett was dressed like a Boer, and in
person was quite as dirty as a Boer; his loose
cracker-trousers were girt by a broad belt
with a square buckle, whereat hung a leopard-skin
pouch and an ugly hunting-knife with a
cross hilt.  In the band of his broad hat were
stuck a large meerschaum pipe and the tattered
remnant of an ostrich feather.
</p>

<p>
The Kaffir ostler now came hurriedly in,
and announced something in his own language
to the landlord, who, turning abruptly to
Florian, said&mdash;
</p>

<p>
'You are in something of a fix, Sergeant!'
</p>

<p>
'How&mdash;what do you mean?' demanded Florian.
</p>

<p>
'That your horse is dying.'
</p>

<p>
'Dying!'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, of the regular horse-sickness.'
</p>

<p>
Florian in no small anxiety and excitement
hurried out to the stable, in which two other
nags were stalled, and there he saw the poor
animal he had ridden lying among the straw
in strong convulsions, labouring under that
curse of South Africa, the horse-sickness, a
most mysterious disorder, which had suddenly
attacked it.
</p>

<p>
The animal had looked sullen and dull all
morning, and in the stable had been assailed
by the distemper and its usual symptoms,
heaving flanks, disturbed breathing, glassy
eyes, and a projecting tongue tightly clenched
between the teeth.  Then came the convulsions,
and he was dead in half an hour,
and Florian found that he would probably
have to travel afoot for more than twenty
miles before he could rejoin the column on
the morrow.
</p>

<p>
'Where have you come from, Sergeant?'
asked Josh Jarrett, when they returned to the
public room.
</p>

<p>
'The fort at the Drakensberg, last.'
</p>

<p>
'Taking French leave, eh?' said Jarrett,
with a portentous wink and a brightening eye.
</p>

<p>
'Not at all!' replied Florian, indignantly.
</p>

<p>
'Fellows do so every day now in these
short-service times.'
</p>

<p>
'I was going to the front, when my horse
fell lame.'
</p>

<p>
'Belong to the Mounted Infantry?'
</p>

<p>
'The dismounted now, I think,' replied
Florian.  'I should like to rest here for the
night, and push on as best I can to-morrow;
so what can I have for supper?'
</p>

<p>
Josh Jarrett paused a moment, as if he
thought a sergeant's purse would not go far
in the way of luxuries, and then replied:
</p>

<p>
'Rasher of bacon and eggs, or dried beef
and a good glass of squareface or Cape smoke,
which you please.'
</p>

<p>
'The first will do, and a glass of the
squareface, which means Hollands, I suppose.
Cape smoke is a disagreeable spirit,' replied
Florian wearily, as he took off his helmet
and seated himself in a large cane-bottomed
chair.
</p>

<p>
'Won't you lay aside your revolver?' asked
Jarrett.
</p>

<p>
'Thanks&mdash;well, no&mdash;I am used to it.'
</p>

<p>
'As you please,' said the other surlily, and
summoning in a loud voice a female named
'Nan,' left the room.
</p>

<p>
The latter laid the table, brought in the
frugal supper, with a case bottle of squareface,
and, instead of leaving the room, seated
herself near a window and entered into conversation,
with what object Florian scarcely knew,
but he disliked the circumstance, till he began
to remember that she probably considered
herself his equal.
</p>

<p>
When his hasty repast was over, taking a
hint from a remark that he was weary, she
withdrew, and then Florian began to consider
the situation.
</p>

<p>
He was fully twenty miles from the regiment;
a rough country, not to be traversed
even by daylight, infested with wild animals,
and many obnoxious things, such as
puff-adders, perhaps Zulus, lay between; and
unless Jarrett would accommodate him with
a horse, which was very unlikely (he seemed
such a sullen and forbidding fellow), he would
have to travel the journey on foot, and begin
betimes on the morrow as soon as dawn would
enable him to see the track eastward.
</p>

<p>
He examined Sheldrake's handsome revolver
and its ammunition, reloading the six
chambers carefully.  Then he thought of the
company's money; and tempted, he knew
not by what rash impulse unless it was mere
boyish curiosity, he untied the red tape by
which the paymaster had secured the mouth
of the bag to have a peep at the gold.
</p>

<p>
He had never seen a hundred sovereigns
before, and never before had so much money
in his possession.  Some of the glittering
coins fell out on the clay floor; and as he
gathered them up a sound made him look
round, and from the window he saw a human
face suddenly vanish outside, thus showing
that some one had, hitherto unnoticed, been
furtively watching him, and he strongly
suspected it to be the woman Nan, prompted,
perhaps, by idle curiosity, and in haste he
concealed the gold.
</p>

<p>
He was the more convinced of the lurker
being she when, soon after, she entered, retook
her seat by the window, through which the
evening sun was streaming now, and began
to address him in a light and flippant manner,
as if to get up a flirtation with him for ulterior
purposes; but his suspicions were awakened
now, and Florian was on his guard.
</p>

<p>
He perceived that she had made some
alterations and improvements in her tawdry
dress, and had hung in her ears a pair of
large old-fashioned Dutch ear-rings shaped
like small rams' horns of real gold.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to be about thirty years of
age, and was not without personal attractions,
though all bloom was past, and the
expression of her face was marred by its being
alternately leering, mocking, and&mdash;even in
spite of herself&mdash;cruel.  Yet her eyes were
dark and sparkling.  She wore a fringe of
thick brown hair close down to them,
concealing nearly all her forehead.  Her mouth,
if large, was handsome, but lascivious-looking,
and Florian, whose barrack-room
experience had somewhat 'opened his eyes,'
thought&mdash;though he was not ungallant
enough to say so&mdash;that her absence would
be preferable to her company, which she
seemed resolved to thrust upon him.  But
guests were doubtless scarce in these parts,
and the 'Royal Hotel,' Elandsbergen, had
probably not many visitors.
</p>

<p>
She asked him innumerable questions&mdash;his
age, country, regiment, and so forth&mdash;and all
in a wheedling coaxing way, toyed with his
hair, and once attempted to seat herself on
his knee; but he rose and repelled her, and
then it was that the unmistakably cruel
expression came flashing into her eyes.
</p>

<p>
'You are too young and too handsome
to be killed and disembowelled by the big
Zulus,' said she after a pause; 'they could
eat a boy like you.  Why don't you desert
and go to the Diamond Fields?'
</p>

<p>
'Thank you; I would die rather than do that!'
</p>

<p>
'And so you serve the Queen, my dear?'
she said sneeringly.
</p>

<p>
'Yes.'
</p>

<p>
'For what reason do you fight the poor Zulus?'
</p>

<p>
'Honour,' replied Florian curtly.
</p>

<p>
'I have read&mdash;I have some book-knowledge,
you see&mdash;that when a Swiss officer
was reproached by a French one that he
fought for pay, and not like himself for
honour, "So be it," replied the Swiss, "we
each of us fight for that which he is most in
need of."'
</p>

<p>
'I don't see the allusion in this instance:
a soldier, I do my duty and obey orders.'
</p>

<p>
'Have a drop more of the squareface&mdash;you
can't be so rude as to refuse a lady,'
she continued, filling up a long glass, which
she put to her lips, and then to those of
Florian, who pretended to sip and then put
the glass down.
</p>

<p>
He was at a loss to understand her and
her advances.  Vanity quite apart, he knew
that he was a good-looking young fellow,
and that his uniform 'set him off;' but he
remembered the face at the window, and was
on his guard against her in every way.
Would she have acted thus with an officer? he
thought; and in what relation did she
stand to the truculent-looking landlord&mdash;wife,
daughter, or sister?  Probably none
of them at all.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly her mood changed, or appeared
to do so, and seating herself at a rickety old
piano, which Florian had not noticed before,
she, while eyeing him waggishly, proceeded
to sing a once-popular flash song, long since
forgotten in England, and probably taken
out by some ancient settler, generations
ago, to the Cape Colony:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'If I was a wife, and my dearest life<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Took it into his noddle to die,<br />
  Ere I took the whim to be buried with him,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I'd know very well <i>why</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'If poignant my grief, I'd search for relief&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not sink with the weight of my care:<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think I know very well <i>where</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  'Another kind mate should give me what fate<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would not from the former allow;<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think I'd know very well <i>how</i>.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  ''Tis true I'm a maid, and so't may be said<br />

  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I think I know very well <i>what</i>.'<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
This she sang with a skill and power that
savoured of the music hall, and then tried
her blandishments again to induce Florian to
drink of the fiery squareface; but he resisted
all her inducement to take 'just one little
glass more.'
</p>

<p>
Why was she so anxious that he should
imbibe that treacherous spirit, which he
would have to pay for?  And why did the
landlord, who certainly seemed full of
curiosity about him, leave him so entirely
in her society?
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the voice of the latter was heard
shouting, 'Nan, Nan!'
</p>

<p>
'That is Josh,' said she impatiently;
'bother him, what does he want now?  Josh
is getting old, and nothing improves by age.'
</p>

<p>
'Except brandy,' said Florian smiling, as
he now hoped to be rid of her.
</p>

<p>
'Right; and squareface, perhaps.  Have
one glass more, dear, before I leave you.'
</p>

<p>
But he turned impatiently away, and she
withdrew, closing a scene which caused
Florian much suspicion and perplexity.  He
remembered to have read, that 'man destroys
with the horns of a bull, or with paws like a
bear; woman by nibbling like a mouse, or
by embracing like a serpent.'  And he was
in toils here unseen as yet!
</p>

<p>
The light faded out beyond the dark
ridges of the Drakensberg, and Florian
requested to be shown to his sleeping-apartment,
which was on the upper storey.
</p>

<p>
'You may hear a roaring lot here
by-and-by,' said his host; 'but you are a soldier,
and I dare say will sleep sound enough.  You
will be tired, too, after your ride.'
</p>

<p>
The man had now a sneaking and wicked
look in his eyes, which avoided meeting
those of Florian, and which the latter did
not like, but there was no help for it then.
</p>

<p>
'You will call me early if I sleep too
long,' said Florian, as Jarrett gave him a
candle.
</p>

<p>
The hand of the latter shook as he did
so&mdash;he had evidently been drinking heavily,
and his yellow-balled eyes were bloodshot,
and his voice thick, as he said:
</p>

<p>
'Good-night, Sergeant; you'll sleep sound
enough,' and closed the door.
</p>

<p>
With a sigh almost of relief Florian found
himself alone.  He set down the sputtering
candle, and turned to fasten the door.  It
was without a lock, and secured only by a
latch, by which it could be opened from the
outside as well as within.
</p>

<p>
On making this startling discovery, Florian's
heart glowed with indignation and growing
alarm!  He felt himself trapped!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap20"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
BAFFLED!
</h3>

<p>
The room was small, low-ceiled, and its only
furniture was a table, chair, and truckle-bed&mdash;all
obviously of Dutch construction&mdash;and,
unless he could find some means to secure
his door, he resolved to remain awake till
dawn.  The only window in the room
overlooked the roof of the stable where the
dead horse lay.  The sash was loose, and
shook in the night wind, and he could see
the bright and, to him, new constellations
glittering in the southern sky.
</p>

<p>
Florian contrived to secure the door by
placing the chair on the floor as a wedge or
barrier between it and the bedstead, on the
mattress of which&mdash;though not very savoury
in appearance&mdash;he cast himself, for he was
weary, worn, and felt that there was an
absolute necessity for husbanding his strength,
as he knew not what might be before him, so
he extinguished the candle.
</p>

<p>
Something in the general aspect and bearing
of the man Josh Jarrett, and in those of the
woman, with her efforts to intoxicate him, and
something, too, in his general surroundings
and isolated situation&mdash;for the few scattered
houses of Elandsbergen were all far
apart&mdash;together with the memory of the prying face
he had seen at the window, at the very
moment he was picking up the gold, all
served to put Florian on his guard; thus he
lay down without undressing, and, longing
only for daylight, grasped ever and anon the
butt of his pistol.
</p>

<p>
For some time past he had been unused
to the luxury of even a truckle-bed or other
arrangements for repose than his grey
greatcoat and ammunition blanket, with a
knapsack for a pillow; hence, despite his
keen anxiety, he must have dropped asleep,
for how long he knew not; but he suddenly
started up as the sound of voices below came
to his ear, and the full sense of his peculiar
whereabouts rushed on him.
</p>

<p>
Voices!  They were coarse and deep, but
not loud&mdash;voices of persons talking in low
and concentrated tones in the room beneath,
separated from him only by the ill-fitting boarding
of the floor, between the joints of which
lines of light were visible, and one bright
upward flake, through a hole from which a
knot had dropped out.
</p>

<p>
'Curse him, he's but a boy; I could
smash the life out of him by one blow of
my fist!' he heard his host, Josh Jarrett,
say.
</p>

<p>
Others responded to this, but in low,
stealthy, and husky tones.  Certain that
some mischief with regard to himself was on
the <i>tapis</i>.  Florian crept softly to the orifice
in the floor, and looked down.  Round a
dirty and sloppy table, covered with
drinking-vessels, pipes and tobacco-pouches, bottles
of squareface and Cape smoke, were Josh
Jarrett and three other ruffians, digger-like
fellows, with Nan among them, all drinking;
and a vile-looking quintette they were,
especially the woman, with her hair all
dishevelled now, and her face inflamed by
that maddening compound known as Cape
smoke.
</p>

<p>
'When I was ass enough to be in the
Queen's service,' said Jarrett with a horrible
imprecation, 'these 'ere blooming officers and
non-comms. led me a devil of a life; they
said it was my own fault that I was always
drunk and in the mill.  Be that as it may,
I've one of the cursed lot upstairs, and I'll
sarve him out for what they made me
undergo, cuss 'em.  One will answer my
purpose as well as another.  Nan, you did
your best to screw him, but he was
wary&mdash;infernally wary.  Blest if I don't think the
fellow is a Scotsman after all, for all his
English lingo.'
</p>

<p>
'Yes, he did shirk his liquor,' hiccupped
the amiable Nan; 'you should have drugged
it, Josh.'
</p>

<p>
'But then we didn't know that he had all
this chink about him.'
</p>

<p>
'That must be ours,' growled a fellow who
had not yet spoken, but was prodding the
table with a knife he had drawn from his
belt; 'we'll give him a through ticket to the
other world&mdash;one with the down train.'
</p>

<p>
'And no return,' added Nan, laughing.
</p>

<p>
Florian felt beads of perspiration on his
brow; he was one against five&mdash;entrapped,
baited, done to death&mdash;and if he did not
appear at headquarters with the fatal money,
what would be thought of him but that he
had deserted with it, and his name would
be branded as that of a coward and robber.
</p>

<p>
Dulcie!  The thought of Dulcie choked
him, but it nerved him too.
</p>

<p>
Another truculent-looking fellow now came
in, making five men in all.
</p>

<p>
'He has money galore on him&mdash;Nan saw
the gold&mdash;money in a canvas bag.  How
comes he, a sergeant, to have all this in his
grab, unless he stole it?' said Jarrett, in
explanation to the new-comer.
</p>

<p>
'Of course he stole it&mdash;it's regimental
money, and evidently he is deserting with
it,' said the other, who was no doubt, like
Jarrett, a Queen's bad bargain also; for he
added, 'What the devil do Cardwell's short-service
soldiers care about their chances of
pension or promotion&mdash;that's the reason he
has the bag of gold; so why shouldn't we
make it ours?  It is only dolloping a knife
into him, and then burying him out in the
veldt before daylight.  Even if he was
traced here, who is to be accountable for a
deserter?'
</p>

<p>
And this practical ruffian proceeded at
once to put a finer edge and point upon his
long bowie knife.
</p>

<p>
'You forget that he has a revolver,' said Nan.
</p>

<p>
'I don't,' said Jarrett; 'but he ain't likely
to use it in his sleep, especially when we pin
him by the throat.'
</p>

<p>
He was but one against five armed and
reckless desperadoes; and there was the
woman, too, whose hands were ready for
evil work.  The stair that led to his room
was narrow&mdash;so much so that there was but
space for one on a step.  The lower or outer
door he knew to be securely locked and
bolted.  The window of his room, we have
said, overlooked the lean-to roof of the
stable, where he knew that two horses were
in stall&mdash;a sure means of escape could he
reach one; but the door, he was aware, was
locked, and the key in possession of the
Kaffir groom.
</p>

<p>
He was maddened by the thought that his
barbarous and obscure death would brand
him with a double disgrace; and death is
more than ever hard when suffered at the
hands of cowards.
</p>

<p>
'What is the use of all this blooming
talk?' said one, starting from the table; 'let
us set about the job at once!'
</p>

<p>
'Look you,' said Jarrett, 'if roused he'll
perhaps try to escape by the stable-roof, so
while you fellows go up the stair, I go round
to the back of the house and cut off his
retreat.'
</p>

<p>
'The stable-roof,' thought Florian, 'my
only chance lies that way.'
</p>

<p>
He opened the window at the very
moment that stealthy steps sounded on the
wooden stair, and a red light streamed under
the door, which their felon hands failed to
force, so firmly was the chair wedged
between it and the bed.  He slid down the
stable-roof, and dropped safely on the ground,
to be faced by Josh Jarrett, who came rushing
on, knife in hand, but Florian shot him
down, firing two chambers into his very
teeth, and then he sprang away like a hare
out into the open veldt, leaving the ruffian
wallowing in his blood.
</p>

<p>
He knew not and cared not in what
direction he ran at first, as he could hear the
oaths and imprecations of his pursuers, over
whom his youth, lightness, and activity gave
him an advantage; but after a time red-dawn
began to streak the eastern sky, and he
knew that was the direction which, if he was
spared, would take him to the bank of the
Buffalo River.
</p>

<p>
He continued to run at a good steady
double, saving his wind as he did so, and his
courage and confidence rose when he found
that he was distancing his pursuers so much
that he could neither see nor hear anything
of them.
</p>

<p>
As he ran on he thought for a moment or
two of the fierce gleaming eyes and glistening
teeth of Jarrett&mdash;of the blood he had shed,
and the life he had perhaps taken for the
first time, remorsefully; but had he not acted
thus, what would he have been?  A gashed
corpse!
</p>

<p>
'Bah!' he said aloud, 'I am a soldier&mdash;why
such thoughts at all?  Why should I
have mercy when these wretches would have
had none?' and he began to regret that he
had not fired a random shot or two through
the room-door and knocked over some of
them on the staircase.
</p>

<p>
A sound now struck his ear; it was the
thud of galloping hoofs upon the veldt, and
his heart sank as he remembered the two
horses in the stable, where his dead nag was
lying.
</p>

<p>
He looked back, and there, sure enough,
in the grey dawn were two mounted men
riding in scouting fashion, far apart, and he
could not for a moment doubt they were two
of Jarrett's companions in pursuit, thirsting
with avarice and for revenge.
</p>

<p>
He made his way, stumbling wildly and
breathlessly down a wooded ravine to elude
their sight; on and on he strove till a vine
root caught his foot: his hands outstretched
beat the air for a moment, and then he fell
headlong forward and downward into a
donga full of brushwood.
</p>

<p>
For a moment he had a sense of strange
palms, and giant cacti, and of great plants
with long spiky leaves being about him, and
then he became unconscious as he lay there
stunned and bleeding profusely from a wound
in his forehead, which had come in contact
with a stone.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
